<title>About Reform Luach</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Reform Luach is designed to assist Reform rabbis, cantors and lay leaders in planning worship, communal observances, and private rituals.  Understanding that every community's customs are different, Reform Luach offers suggestions for applying Reform <em>siddurim</em>, <em>machzorim</em>, and Torah commentaries to specific days in the Hebrew calendar.  </p>
<p>Reform Luach was compiled in consultation with many Reform sources, including Mark Washofsky's <em>Jewish Living</em>, <em>Mishkan T'filah</em>, the Plaut Torah commentaries, <em>Gates of Repentance</em>, the new Reform High Holy Machzor, <em>Mishkan HaNefesh</em>, <em>Gates of the Seasons</em>, <em>Gates of the House</em>, Josee Wolff and Marshall Portnoy's <em>The Art of Cantillation</em>, and volumes of Reform responsa literature.  References to these sources are given in many Reform Luach entries for those who would like to explore a topic further.  Sources outside of Reform Judaism were also consulted in order to provide a traditional perspective in relevant places; these sources include the Koren-Sacks Siddur and Machzorim, Isaac Klein's <em>A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice</em>, and the USCJ Luach . Holiday summaries are from<em> <a href="https://www.ccarpress.org/shopping_product_detail.asp?pid=50118">Mishkan Moeid: A Guide to the Jewish Sources</a></em>, edited by Rabbi Peter Knobel. Torah portion summaries courtesy of the URJ, from <a href="https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/">https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/</a>. Used with permission.</p>
<p>Suggested liturgy generally reflects our Reform sources; in relevant places, you will also see notation that indicates traditional practice.  Torah and Haftarah selections reflect those indicated by the Plaut Torah commentaries; when Plaut's selections differ from traditional readings for a given day, both traditional readings and Plaut's suggested alternatives are listed.</p>
