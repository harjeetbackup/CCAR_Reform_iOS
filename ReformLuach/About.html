<title>About Reform Luach</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Reform Luach is designed to assist Reform rabbis, cantors and lay leaders in planning worship, communal observances, and private  rituals. It is also meant for those looking to learn more about the Jewish calendar. Understanding  that every community's customs are different, Reform Luach offers suggestions  for applying Reform  <em>siddurim</em>, <em>machzorim</em>, and Torah commentaries to specific days in the Hebrew calendar.</p>
<p>Reform Luach was compiled in consultation with many Reform sources, including <em>Jewish Living</em>, <em> Mishkan T'filah, The Torah A Modern Commentary(original and revised edition)</em>, <em>Gates of Repentance</em>,  the new Reform High Holy Machzor, <em>Mishkan HaNefesh</em>, <em>Gates of the Seasons</em>, <em>Gates of the House</em>, <em>The Art of Cantillation</em>,  and volumes of Reform responsa literature. References to these sources are  given in many Reform Luach entries for those who would like to explore a topic further. Sources outside of Reform Judaism were also consulted in order to  provide a traditional perspective in relevant places; these sources include the  Koren-Sacks Siddur and Machzorim, <em>A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice</em>, and the USCJ Luach. Holiday summaries are from<em> <a href="https://www.ccarpress.org/shopping_product_detail.asp?pid=50118">Mishkan Moeid: A Guide to the Jewish Seasons.</a></em>. Torah portion summaries are courtesy of the Union for Reform Judaism, from <a href="https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/">https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/</a>, and are used with permission. </p>
<p>Suggested liturgy and readings generally reflect our Reform sources; in relevant places, you will also see notation that indicates historical practice. Torah and Haftarah selections reflect those indicated by the Plaut Torah commentaries; when Plaut's selections differ from traditional readings for a given day, both historical readings and Plaut's suggestions are listed.</p>
