<h2>Erev Yom Kippur</h2>
  <p>Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, occurs on the tenth of Tishrei (Leviticus 23:27). It is the culmination of the Ten Days of Repentance. It alone of all the Jewish holidays is the equivalent of Shabbat in sanctity. Its mood is reflective and introspective—a day devoted totally to personal and communal self-examination, confession, and atonement. Yom Kippur provides us with the opportunity to alter our conduct, readjust our values, and set things right in our lives. The day demands absolute honesty as we confess our wrongdoings: “We have gone astray, we have sinned, we have transgressed.” The grandeur of the liturgy and music adds to the                   drama and seriousness of the day. From <em>Kol Nidrei</em>, the eve of Yom Kippur, to the last triumphant note of the shofar at the conclusion of the <em>N’ilah</em> service, its purpose is to move us toward reconciliation with God and our fellow human beings and to aid us to do better in the coming year.</p>
  <p><strong>General Notes<br />
  </strong>We ask forgiveness from others in preparation for Yom Kippur.<br />
  Some have the tradition of immersing in a Mikveh in preparation for Yom Kippur.</p>
  <p><strong>Shacharit</strong>  <br />
  Omit Psalm 100 (MT 104)<br />
  When reciting every Kaddish, after the word &quot;<em>l'eilah</em>,&quot; we add &quot;<em>u'l'eilah</em>.&quot;<br />
  When reciting the Amidah, include passages marked, &quot;Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur&quot;.<br />
  Conclude the service with <em>Achat Sha'alti</em> (MT 662)</p>
  <p><strong>Candlelighting<br />
  </strong>Light candles before sunset. Recite the candle blessing for Yom Kippur, as well as <em>Shehecheyanu</em>. </p>
  <p><strong>Ma'ariv</strong>
    <br />
  Kol Nidre:<br />
  We wear tallot for the Kol Nidre service.<br />
  It is customary to wear white for all Yom Kippur services. Some wear a kittel.</p>
  <strong>During Dinner<br />
  </strong>In the afternoon, before Yom Kippur begins, it is a Mitzvah to eat a S'udah Mafseket. This should be a festive and satisfying meal, beginning with Hamotzi and concluding with a weekday Birkat Hamazon. We finish the meal before sundown, and we light our candles. This meal is not only in preparation for the fast to follow, but also to express our hopes that our Yom Kippur observance will lead us to a good new year (JL 123). Our tradition teaches us that, just as it is a Mitzvah to fast on Yom Kippur, it is also a Mitzvah to eat the day before Yom Kippur. It should be a festive meal, as Erev Yom Kippur is considered a partially festive day: we express our confidence that God with treat us mercifully this Yom Kippur.
