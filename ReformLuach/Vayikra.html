<h2>Parashat Vayikra</h2>
<p>Leviticus 1:1-5:26</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>God instructs Moses on the five different kinds of sacrifices that were to be offered in the sanctuary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>olah</em> or &quot;burnt offering&quot; was a voluntary sacrifice that had a high degree of sanctity and was regarded as the &quot;standard&quot; offering. The entire animal, except for its hide, was burned on the altar. (1:1-17)</li>
      <li>The <em>minchah </em>or &quot;meal offering&quot; was a sacrifice made of flour, oil, salt, and frankincense that was partly burned on the altar and partly given to the priests to eat. (2:1-16)</li>
      <li>The <em>zevach sh'lamim </em>or &quot;sacrifice of well-being&quot; was a voluntary animal offering from one's herd, sometimes brought to fulfill a vow. (3:1-17)</li>
      <li>The <em>chatat </em>or &quot;sin offering&quot; was an obligatory sacrifice that was offered to expiate unintentional sins. This offering differs from the others in the special treatment of the blood of the animal. (4:1-5:13)</li>
      <li>The <em>asham </em>or &quot;penalty offering&quot; was an obligatory sacrifice of a ram that was required chiefly of one who had misappropriated property. (5:1-26) </li>
