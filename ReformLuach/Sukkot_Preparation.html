<h3>Preparing for Sukkot</h3>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>Build a Sukkah (for guidelines on building your Sukkah, see JL 113):</p>
<p>Acquire the 4 species (arba'ah minim). These include an etrog, a lulav, two willow branches (aravah), and three myrtle braches (hadas). It is considered &quot;hiddur Mitzvah&quot; (beautification of the commandment) to acquire a beautiful lulav and etrog.</p>
<p>The lulav, hadas, and aravah are assembled in their holder as follows: Hold the lulav with the smooth spine toward you and slide in into the middle holder. Place one ring around the holder and one or two rings on the lulav itself to hold the fronds together. Do not place the highest ring less than 4 inches from the tip of the lulav. Place the myrtle branches in the right pocket. Place the willow branches in the left pocket.</p>
