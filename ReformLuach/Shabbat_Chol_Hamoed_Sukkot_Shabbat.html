<title>Shabbat Chol Hamoed Sukkot Friday</title>
</head>

<body>
<h3>Shabbat Chol Hamoed</h3>
<h4>Shacharit</h4>
<p>Include Ya'aleh v'Yavo for Sukkot in the Amidah. </p>
<p>Traditionally, N'tilat Lulav (taking of the Lulav) is not performed on Shabbat. Many Reform congregations take the Lulav  on Shabbat.<br />
*In Temple times, N'tilat Lulav was performed in the Temple on the first day of Sukkot, even when it fell on Shabbat.  Later, rabbis prohibited taking the Lulav on Shabbat, as they feared people might carry the Lulav into the public domain.  Reform responsa suggest performing N'tilat Lulav on Shabbat.  See &quot;Blowing of the Shofar,&quot; American Reform Responsa, Vol. XXXIII, 1923, pp. 60-61. <a href="http://ccarnet.org/responsa/arr-121-122/">http://ccarnet.org/responsa/arr-121-122/</a></p>
<p>After the Amidah, we recite a full Hallel (MT 560). The Hallel on page 560 is the Half Hallel; congregations that would like to recite a full Hallel should add appropriate selections from Psalms 115 and 116.  Traditionally, congregations do not wave the Lulav during Hallel on Shabbat, though many Reform congregations do (see above). </p>
<p>After Hallel, the appropriate Hoshanah for this day is traditionally recited.</p>
<p>After Hallel (or Hoshanot, for congregations that recite them), we read Kohelet (Ecclesiastes).</p>
