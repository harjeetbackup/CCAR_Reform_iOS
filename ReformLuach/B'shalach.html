<h2>Parashat B'shalach</h2>
<p>Exodus 13:17−17:16</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Children of Israel escape across the Sea of Reeds from Pharaoh and his army, who drown when God drives back the sea. (13:17-14:31)</li>
  <li>Moses and the Israelites sing a song praising <em>Adonai</em>. (15:1-21)</li>
  <li>In the wilderness, God provides the grumbling Israelites with quails and manna. God instructs the Israelites to gather and prepare on the sixth day food needed for Shabbat. (15:22-16:36)</li>
  <li>The people complain about the lack of water. Moses hits a rock with his rod and brings forth water. (17:1-7)</li>
  <li>Israel defeats Amalek, Israel's eternal enemy. God vows to blot out the memory of Amalek from the world. (17:8-16)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Notes</strong><br />
Parashat B'shalach is called Shabbat Shirah because it includes Shirat Hayam, or the Song of the Sea. The Israelites sing Shirat Hayam to celebrate crossing the Sea of Reeds and to praise God for subduing the Egyptians. </p>
<p><strong>Shacharit </strong><br />
We sing a special melody for parts of Shirat Hayam (15:1-19). Part or all of each of the following verses is chanted to the special melody: 15:1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 16, 18. 15:21 is also chanted to the Shirat Hayam melody. Some congregations have the custom for the reader to chant each phrase and for the congregation to repeat that phrase or to respond with the next phrase. For the Shirat Hayam melody, see ATC 76. </p>
