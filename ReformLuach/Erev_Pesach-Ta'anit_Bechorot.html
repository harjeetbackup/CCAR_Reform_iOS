<h2>Ta'anit Bechorot<br />
  Pesach (Begins at sundown)</h2>
<p>Pesach, which begins on the  fteenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan and lasts for seven days, commemorates the Exodus from Egypt.<br />
While current Pesach observance draws some of its symbolism from the agricultural and pastoral origins of the festival, it is primarily a celebration of the Exodus from Egypt.  The liberation of the Jewish people from Egyptian bondage has become a powerful symbol of redemption—not only the redemption of the Jewish people, but the redemption of the entire world. The <a href="https://www.ccarpress.org/shopping_product_list.asp?catID=3800">Haggadah</a>, reflecting the historical experience of the Jewish people, recognizes that slavery is not limited to physical bondage, but that spiritual slavery and social degradation are no less potent methods of depriving human beings of liberty.</p>
<p><strong>General Notes<br />
</strong><em>Chametz</em> may only be eaten during the early part of the day. Check with your rabbi for the exact time at which you should stop eating <em>chametz</em>.<br />
Traditionally, first-born fast on this day. Ta'anit Bechorot recognizes that the first-born children of the Israelites were saved when the first-born children of the Egpytians were killed.  </p>
<p><strong>Candlelighting<br />
</strong>Before sunset, light candles. Recite the festival candle blessing followed by <em>Shehecheyanu</em> (MT 384).</p>
<p><strong>Ma'ariv<br />
</strong>Recite the festival evening service (MT 384).<br />
Some congregations recite Hallel after the Amidah.</p>
<p><strong>Birkat Hamazon<br />
</strong>Add <em>Ya'aleh v'Yavo</em> for Pesach and <em>Harachaman</em> for Yom Tov.</p>
