<h2>Rosh Hashanah Day 2</h2>
  <p>*Traditionally, Reform congregations have observed one day of Rosh Hashanah as prescribed in Leviticus 23:24 and Numbers 29:1.  However, communities in Israel that generally observe one festival day observe two days of Rosh Hashanah, and many Reform communities have begun to do so, as well. For further discussion of second day Rosh Hashanah observance, see JL 119 and &quot;The Second Festival Day and Reform Judaism.&quot; <em><a href="https://www.ccarpress.org/search.asp?searchString=Reform+Responsa+for+the+Twenty-First+Century">Reform Responsa for the Twenty-First Century</a>.&quot; </em> Edited by Mark Washofsky.

<h3>Asseret Y'mei T'shuva</h3>
  <strong>General Notes<br />
  </strong>During the <em>Aseret Y'mei T'shuvah</em> (10 days of repentance from Rosh Hashanah through Yom Kippur):<br />
  Traditionally, congregations continue reciting S'lichot each morning before shacharit. When reciting every Kaddish, the words &quot;<em>l'eilah min kol</em>,&quot; are changed to &quot;<em>l'eilah u'l'eilah mi-kol</em>.&quot;<br />
  When reciting the Amidah, include passages marked &quot;Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.&quot;<br />
  We continue to conclude our Shacharit and Ma'ariv services with <em>Achat Sha'alti</em> (MT 662).
