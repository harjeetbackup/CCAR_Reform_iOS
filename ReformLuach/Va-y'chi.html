<p><strong>Shacharit Torah Reading Notes </strong><br />
We conclude the book of Genesis. The final verse of the book is chanted with a special melody. As the reader finishes chanting, the congregation rises. Before the <em>oleh</em> chants the concluding Torah blessing, the congregation chants &quot;<em>Chazak, Chazak, V'nitchazek</em>.&quot; The Torah reader then chants the same words. The <em>oleh</em> then recites the concluding Torah blessing. For more detailed instructions and to hear this melody chanted, see ATC 81. </p>
