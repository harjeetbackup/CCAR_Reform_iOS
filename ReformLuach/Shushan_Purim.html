<h3>Shushan Purim</h3>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>Purim is celebrated on this day in walled cities and in Jerusalem. According to the Megillah, the Jews in King Ahasuerus' provinces fought their enemies on the thirteenth day of Adar and rested on the 14th day. The Jews in the walled city of Shushan fought on the thirteenth and fourteenth days and rested on the fifteenth day. For this reason, Jews who live in walled cities (or cities that were walled in the days of Joshua) celebrate Purim on the fifteenth day of Adar.</p>
