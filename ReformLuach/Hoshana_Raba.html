<h2>Sukkot (Chol Hamoed)<br />
  Hoshana Raba</h2>
<strong>General Notes</strong><br />
Traditionally, Hoshanah Raba is considered to be the day of the final sealing of God's judgement. The liturgy for the day is an interesting mixture of weekday and festival liturgy, and we alternate between nusach for weekdays, festivals, S'ichot, and the High Holy Days.
<p><strong>Shacharit<br />
</strong>Add <em>Ya'aleh v'Yavo</em> for <em>Sukkot</em> to the Amidah (MT 92).<br />
Perform <em>N'tilat Lulav</em> (taking of the Lulav) after the Amidah (MT 571).<br />
Recite the full Hallel after the Amidah (560). The Hallel on page 560 is the Half Hallel; congregations that would like to recite a full Hallel should add appropriate selections from Psalms 115 and 116.<br />
Traditionally, after Hallel, the congregation would make 7 processions around the synagogue and recite seven Hoshanot. After the Hoshanot, the congregation would beat the Aravot against the floor.

It is a mitzvah to welcome guests into our Sukkah. Each night of Sukkot, we symbolically welcome some of our patriarchs and matriarchs into our Sukkah as guests. The liturgy of this ceremony can be found in <a href="https://www.ccarpress.org/shopping_product_detail.asp?pid=50141"><em>On the Doorposts of Your House</em></a>, pp. 94-96.<br />
We add <em>Ya'aleh v'Yavo</em> and <em>Harachaman</em> for Sukkot to <em>Birkat hamazon</em>.
