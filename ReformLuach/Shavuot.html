<h2>Shavuot</h2>
<p>Shavuot occurs on the sixth of the Hebrew month of Sivan. The name Shavuot (meaning “weeks”) derives from its celebration seven weeks (a week of weeks) after Pesach.<br />
Current observance is based on the Talmudic identification of Shavuot with the events at Sinai. Therefore it is called<em> z’man matan Torateinu</em>, “the season of the giving of the Torah.” On Shavuot, we celebrate our covenantal relationship with God and reafirm our commitment to a Jewish life of study (<em>talmud Torah</em>) and practice (<em>mitzvah</em>). The significance of the events at Sinai derives not only from the receiving of <em>mitzvot</em> but also from their acceptance, as is illustrated in Israel’s response. The ceremony of confirmation (<em>Kabbalat Torah</em>) is a Reform innovation and has added a new dimension to the meaning of the festival. It provides an opportunity for students of post–bar/bat mitzvah age to affirm their relationship to Judaism and the Jewish people. <br />

<p><strong>Shacharit Torah Reading Notes<br />
</strong>The Torah reading for Shavuot contains the reading of the Decalogue (20:2-14). There are two sets of trope for this passage. The <em>Ta'amei Ha'tachton</em> are used for study and divide verses into a more manageable length. The <em>Ta'amei Ha'elyon</em> are used for public reading and give each commandment its own verse. We chant this section of the Torah portion according to the <em>Ta'amei Ha'elyon</em>. For the <em>Ta'amei Ha'Elyon</em>, see RP 476.</p>
