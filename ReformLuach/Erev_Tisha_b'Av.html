<h2>Tisha b'Av (begins at sundown)</h2>
<p><strong>General Notes<br />
</strong>Before sunset, eat a <em>s'udah mafseket</em>. There is a custom to eat no more than one cooked item.<br />
This is a twenty-five hour fast. The fast begins at sundown.</p>
<p><strong>Ma'ariv<br />
</strong>We recite a weekday Ma'ariv service.<br />
After the Amidah, chant Eicha and Kinot.<br />
Traditionally, the lights of the synagogue are dimmed for this part of the service, and the congregation sits in low seats or on the floor.<br />
</p>
<p> The end of Eicha is chanted as follows:</p>
<ul type="square"><li>The congregation chants 5:21 with the reader</li>
  <li>The reader chants 5:22</li>
  <li>The congregation chants 5:21</li>
<li>The reader repeats 5:21</li></ul>
