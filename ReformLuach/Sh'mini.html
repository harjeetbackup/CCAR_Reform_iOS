<h2>Parashat Sh'mini</h2>
<p>Leviticus 9:1-11:47</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Aaron and his sons follow Moses' instructions and offer sacrifices so that God will forgive the people. (9:1-24)</li>
  <li>Two of Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, offer &quot;alien fire&quot; to God. God punishes these two priests by killing them immediately. (10:1-3)</li>
  <li>God forbids Moses, Aaron, and his surviving sons from mourning but commands the rest of the people to do so. Priests are told not to drink alcohol before entering the sacred Tabernacle and are further instructed about making sacrifices. (10:4-20)</li>
  <li>Laws are given to distinguish between pure and impure animals, birds, fish, and insects. (11:1-47)</li>

<p><strong>Splitting the Parsha</strong><br />
  When the 8th day of Pesach falls on Shabbat, in order to realign the Reform Torah reading schedule with the Diaspora, the parsha is split as follows:<br />
<strong>Sh'mini I:</strong> Leviticus 9:1-10:11<br />
<strong>Sh'mini II:</strong> Leviticus 10:12–11:47</p>
<p>Why do we do this? It is one of the rare examples where the lectionary (cycle of Torah readings) in the Reform Movement differs from that of the rest of the Jewish world. In the rest of the Diaspora, festivals are observed for two days (stemming from the time before the calendar was fixed), so the Shabbat that is considered to be the eighth day of Passover (that is, the second day of the conclusion of the festival), on which a special Torah portion is read (Deuteronomy 14:22-16:17). But because the calendar has been fixed for millennia, the Reform Movement has never observed the second day of festivals. So for us, it is a regular Shabbat when we continue the cycle of Torah readings with <em>Sh'mini </em>(Leviticus 9:1-11:47). The problem is that if on the <em>following </em>week we were to read the next portion, <em>Tazria/M'tzora, </em>we would be completely out of sync with the rest of the Jewish world, which would be reading <em>Sh'mini. </em>Striving to balance Reform festival practice with our simultaneous commitment to <em>K'lal Yisrael, </em>&quot;the whole community of Israel,&quot; the Movement decided to split the <em>Sh'mini </em>portion in two, reading <em>Sh'mini I</em> when the rest of the Jewish world reads the eighth day of Pesach portion, and <em>Sh'mini II, </em>the other half, the following week, joining the rest of the Jewish world in the same Torah reading.</p>
