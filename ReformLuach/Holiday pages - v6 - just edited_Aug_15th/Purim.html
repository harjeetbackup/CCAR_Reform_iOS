    <h2>Purim</h2>
    <p>Purim, which occurs on the fourteenth of the Hebrew month of Adar
      (or in Jerusalem, on the fifteenth), is a celebration of the
      events described in the Scroll of Esther (<i>M’gilat Esther</i>).
      The holiday, with its joyous carnival-like atmosphere, focuses on
      one of the main themes in Jewish history—the survival of the
      Jewish people despite the attempts of their enemies to destroy
      them. According to the Scroll of Esther, the name Purim is derived
      from the lot (<i>pur</i>) cast by Haman to determine the day on
      which the Jews would be exterminated (Esther 3:7).</p>
    <p><strong>General Notes</strong></p>
    <p>The Mitzvot of Purim:<br>
      It is a Mitzvah to hear the reading of <i>M'gilat Esther</i>. The
      <i>M'gilah</i> is historically read at both the evening and
      morning services.&nbsp;On Purim, we give <i>Mishloach Manot,</i>
      gifts of food and drink to our family and friends. One should give
      at least two types of food to one person. &nbsp;It is also a
      Mitzvah to give <i>Matanot L'Evyonim</i>, gifts to the poor. We
      should give a gift to at least two people.&nbsp;Finally, one
      should partake of a <i>S'udat Purim</i>, a festive Purim meal in
      the afternoon.</p>
    <p><strong>Procedure for Reading the <i>M'gillah</i></strong>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The reader should unroll the <i>M'gilah</i> scroll and fold
        it like a letter.</li>
      <li>The reader recites the blessings before beginning to chant (MT
        573).</li>
      <li>The reader then chants the <i>M'gilah</i>, keeping in mind
        the following:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Many communities have the custom to recite certain verses to
          special melodies. These verses and melodies vary from
          community to community.</li>
        <li>The following verses are chanted according to the trope for
          the book of Lamentations: 1:7, 2:6, 3:15, 4:1, 4:16</li>
        <li>Before the reader chants 2:5, 8:15, 8:16, and 10:3, the
          congregation should recite the verses. The reader should then
          continue with the chanting of the special verse.</li>
        <li>In 9:7, the names of Haman's sons are historically chanted
          quickly on one note, and in one breath, if possible.</li>
        <li>Whenever the reader chants Haman's name, the congregation
          makes noise in an effort to blot out his name.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The reader then chants the blessing after the <i>M'gillah</i>.
        These blessings can be found in the Koren Siddur, pp. 903-904.
        Historically, this blessing is followed by the chanting of <i>Shoshanat

          Yaakov</i>.</li>
    </ol>

      Chant, Sacred Music Press, 1963.</p>
