    <h3>Counting the Omer</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>During the seven weeks from the second night of Pesach until
      Shavuot, we count the Omer. In ancient times, the omer represented
      the first sheaf of the harvest that God instructed the Israelites
      to bring to the priest (Leviticus 23). The Israelites were then to
      count fifty days between the bringing of the omer and the bringing
      of a second offering of new grain. The Omer also helps us to make
      a connection between Pesach, when we were liberated from bondage,
      and Shavuot, when we received the Torah.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In early Rabbinic times, the omer took on additional significance
      as a period of mourning: our tradition teaches that twelve
      thousand of Rabbi Akiva's disciples died between Pesach and
      Shavuot. Our rabbis teach that these disciples of Rabbi Akiva were
      afflicted by a deadly plague because they did not respect one
      another; historians ascribe their deaths to&nbsp;the Hadrianic
      persecutions following the Bar Kochba revolt. Some engage in some
      mourning practices either throughout the Omer or until Lag
      Ba'Omer: these include refraining from haircuts, scheduling
      weddings, and holding celebrations with live music and dancing.</p>
    <p>We count the Omer each night after dark with a blessing. One who
      forgets to count at night may count in the morning; the counting
      in the morning is historically done without a blessing.&nbsp;The
      Omer is counted during the <i>Maariv</i> service before <i>Aleinu</i>
      and can be found in <i>Mishkan T'filah</i> on page 570.</p>
