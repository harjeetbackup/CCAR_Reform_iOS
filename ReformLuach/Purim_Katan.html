<h2>Purim Katan </h2>
<p><strong>General Notes<br />
</strong>In years when there are two months of Adar, we celebrate Purim Katan on the 14th day of Adar I. There are no special observances on this day, but it should be a day of joy during which we celebrate the miracle of Purim. The Mishnah teaches, &quot;There is no difference between Adar I and Adar II, except for the reading of the Megillah and the giving of gifts to the poor&quot; (BT Megillah 6b). While we do not perform the Mitzvot of Purim on Purim Katan, we should remember and celebrate the miracle of Purim.</p>
