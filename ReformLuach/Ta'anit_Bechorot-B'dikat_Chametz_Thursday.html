<title>Ta'anit Bechorot/B'dikat Chametz Thursday</title>
</head>

<body>
<p><strong>Ta'anit Bechorot</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, first-born males fast on this day. Ta'anit Bechorot recognizes that the first-born children of the Israelites were saved when the first-born children of the Egpytians were killed. Â When Pesach begins on Saturday night, this fast is moved to the Thursday before Pesach.</p>
