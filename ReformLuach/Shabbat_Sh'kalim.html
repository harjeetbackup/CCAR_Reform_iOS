<h3>Shabbat Sh'kalim</h3>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>Shabbat Sh'kalim is the first of a series of five special Shabbatot before Passover. It is on the Shabbat before Rosh Chodesh Adar (Adar II, during leap years). In this week's additional Torah reading (Exodus 30:11-16), we read that every adult Jew contributed a half-shekel to the upkeep of the Tent of Meeting. The special Haftarah from II Kings commemorates the half-shekel each person contributed each year to the upkeep of the Temple. We commemorate this practice on Shabbat Sh'kalim, because the financial year for the Temple began in Nisan, so the half-shekel was generally collected a month earlier, in Adar. On Purim, synagogues often gather contributions to the poor; these contributions are called &quot;<em>machatzit ha'shekel</em>&quot; in memory of the half-shekel given in Temple times.</p>
