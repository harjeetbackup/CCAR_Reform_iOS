<h2>Erev Rosh Hashanah</h2>
<p>Rosh HaShanah, which falls on the  first of the Hebrew month of Tishrei, marks the beginning of the new year. It is, however, far more than the first day of the calendar year. It is the beginning of a ten-day period of rigorous introspection and self-examination that continues through Yom Kippur. So important did the Rabbis consider this period, that they proclaimed the whole of the preceding month of Elul as a period of preparation.</p>
<p><strong>General Notes </strong><br />
It is customary for synagogues to replace the Torah cover, <em>Parochet</em> (curtain covering the Ark), and cover of the reading table with white ones until after Yom Kippur.<br />
It is  customary to visit the graves of loved ones on this day. </p>
<p><strong>Shacharit </strong><br />
We do not sound the shofar during Shacharit. <br />
Conclude the service with <em>Achat Shaalti</em> (MT 662). </p>
<p><strong>Candlelighting </strong><br />
Light candles before sunset. <br />
Recite the candle blessing for Shabbat and festivals, followed by <em>Shehecheyanu</em> (MT 384). </p>
<p><strong>Maariv </strong>(on Shabbat)<br />
We recite an abbreviated Kabbalat Shabbat, consisting of Psalms 92 and 93, before Ma'ariv. Some congregations also recite an abbreviated <em>L'chah Dodi</em> before reciting Psalm 92. <br />
Include other changes for Shabbat as indicated in the machzor.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>During Dinner </strong><br />
We recite the Kiddush for Rosh Hashanah evening, with appropriate additions for Shabbat. Kiddush is followed by <em>Shehecheyanu</em>. <br />
Before making HaMotzi, dip an apple in honey and recite the following: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="direction:rtl; text-align:left">יְהִי רָצוֹן מִלְּפָנֶֽיךָ‚  יְיָ אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ וֵאלֹהֵי אֲבוֹתֵֽינוּ וְאִמּוֹתֵֽינוּ‚  שֶׁתְּחַדֵּשׁ עָלֵֽינוּ שָׁנָה טוֹבָה וּמְתוּקָה.</p>
  <p>  <em>Y’hi ratzon mil’fanecha, Adonai Eloheinu v’Elohei avoteinu v’imoteinu, shet’chadeish aleinu shanah tovah umtukah!</em></p>
  <p>Our God and God of our ancestors, Eternal God of all generations: <br />
    May Your presence in our lives this New Year renew our spirits and renew our strength.<br />
    May it be a good year. May it be a sweet year.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, recite the blessing over fruit and eat the apple.<br />
  We then make HaMotzi over two Challot. It is customary to eat round challot during this season. Some people sprinkle honey over their challah rather than salt. <br />
We add <em>Ya'aleh v'Yavo</em> and <em>Harachaman</em> for Rosh Hashanah to <em>Birkat hamazon</em>.</p>
