<h2>Pesach Sheini</h2>
<p>In Temple times, those who were unable to offer the Passover sacrifice at the required time could offer it a month later (see Numbers 9:6-12), on the 14th of Iyyar. This day was named Pesach Sheini. There are no changes to our liturgy on this day, though some have the custom to eat a piece of Matzvah to commemorate it.</p>
