<body>
<h2>Sukkot Day 2 (Chol Hamoed)</h2>
<p><strong>Shacharit</strong>
  <br />
  Recite weekday Shacharit (MT 24).<br />
  Add <em>Ya'aleh v'Yavo</em> for Sukkot to the Amidah (MT 92).<br />
  Perform <em>N'tilat Lulav </em>(taking up the Lulav) after the Amidah (MT 571).<br />
  Recite the full Hallel after the Amidah (MT 560). The Hallel on page 560 is the Half Hallel; congregations that would like to recite a full Hallel should add appropriate selections from Psalms 115 and 116.<br />
  After Hallel, congregations traditionally recite the appropriate Hoshanot for this day.<br />
Conclude service with Achat Sha'alti (MT 662)</p>
<p><strong>Shacharit Torah Reading - Traditional</strong>
  <br />
  Numbers 29:17-22 (P 1213, RP 1085, WTC 980)<br />
4 Aliyot</p>
<p><strong>Shacharit Torah Reading - Alternative</strong>
  <br />
  The Plaut Torah commentary suggests alternative readings for each day of Sukkot (RP 1601), which include a Yom Tov reading for the second day of Sukkot.  We suggest a slight reworking of these readings in order to begin Chol Hamoed readings on the second day of Sukkot.  Our suggested readings are as follows:<br />
  1st Weekday of Chol HaMoed: Exodus 23:14-17 (P 588, RP 521, WTC 440)<br />
  2nd Weekday of Chol Hamoed: Exodus 34:21-24 (P 660, RP 595, WTC 512)<br />
  3rd Weekday of Chol Hamoed: Deuteronomy 16:13-17 (P 1450, RP 1274, WTC 1133)<br />
  4th Weekday of Chol Hamoed: Deuteronomy 31:9-13 (P 1548, RP 1388, WTC 1239)<br />
Shabbat Chol Hamoed: Exodus 33:12-34:26 (P 657, RP 592, WTC 508) or Deuteronomy 8:1-10 (P 1387, RP 1229, WTC 1094)</p>
<p><strong>During Meals</strong> <br />
Recite the blessing over dwelling in the Sukkah.<br />
It is a mitzvah to welcome guests into our Sukkah. Each night of Sukkot, we symbolically welcome some of our patriarchs and matriarchs into our Sukkah as guests. The liturgy of this ceremony can be found in <a href="https://www.ccarpress.org/shopping_product_detail.asp?pid=50141"><em>On the Doorposts of Your House</em></a>, pp. 94-96.<br />
We add <em>Ya'aleh v'Yavo</em> and <em>Harachaman</em> for Sukkot to <em>Birkat hamazon</em>.<br />
