<title>Rosh Hashanah Day 1</title>

  <h2>Rosh Hashanah Day 1</h2>
  <p>Rosh HaShanah, which falls on the  first of the Hebrew month of Tishrei, marks the beginning of the new year. It is, however, far more than the first day of the calendar year. It is the beginning of a ten-day period of rigorous introspection and self-examination that continues through Yom Kippur. So important did the Rabbis consider this period, that they proclaimed the whole of the preceding month of Elul as a period of preparation.</p>

  <p><strong>Afternoon<br />
  </strong>Tashlich:<br />
  We hold the Tashlich ceremony in the afternoon at a natural body of water.<br />
This ritual is based on Micah 7:18-20, and many congregations recite these verses as part of the ceremony. When the first day of Rosh Hashanah falls on Shabbat, we do Tashlich on the second day of Rosh Hashanah.  </p>
  <p><strong>Birkat Hamazon</strong>
    <br />
  Add Ya'aleh v'Yavo and Harachaman for Rosh Hashanah to Birkat Hamazon.</p>
  <p><strong>During Lunch<br />
  </strong>Recite the Kiddush for Rosh Hashanah day.<br />
  Some dip apples into honey (others only do this on Rosh Hashanah evening). For the ritual, see Rosh Hashanah evening.<br />
Make Hamotzi over two round challot.  </p>
  <p><strong>Candlelighting</strong>
    <br />
  We place a new fruit on the table during candlelighting and Kiddush. When we recite Shehecheyanu during candlelighting and Kiddush, we have in mind that we are reciting it over the new fruit as well.<br />
  After dark, we light candles. We recite the festival candle blessing and Shehecheyanu (MT 384)</p>
  <strong>During Dinner<br />
  </strong>Recite Kiddush for Rosh Hashanah evening, followed by Shehecheyanu.<br />
  We then say a blessing over the new fruit and eat it.<br />
Make Hamotzi over two round challot.

<h3>Asseret Y'mei T'shuva</h3>
  <strong>General Notes<br />
  </strong>During the <em>Aseret Y'mei T'shuvah</em> (10 days of repentance from Rosh Hashanah through Yom Kippur):<br />
  Traditionally, congregations continue reciting S'lichot each morning before shacharit. When reciting every Kaddish, the words &quot;<em>l'eilah min kol</em>,&quot; are changed to &quot;<em>l'eilah u'l'eilah mi-kol</em>.&quot;<br />
  When reciting the Amidah, include passages marked &quot;Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.&quot;<br />
  We continue to conclude our Shacharit and Ma'ariv services with<em> Achat Sha'alti</em> (MT 662).
