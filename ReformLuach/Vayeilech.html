  <li>Moses tells the assembled people that God’s covenant speaks to them and to all of the generations who will follow. (29:9–14)</li>
  <li>God warns the Israelites that they will be punished if they act idolatrously, the way the inhabitants of the other nations do. (29:15–28)</li>
  <li>Moses reassures the people that God will not forsake them and that they can attain blessings by following God's commandments. (30:1–20)</li>
  <li>Moses prepares the people for his death and announces that Joshua will succeed him. (31:1–8)</li>

<p><strong>Haftarah Notes </strong><br />
The name &quot;Shabbat Shuvah&quot; is based on the first word of the reading from Hosea (Some also point to the word &quot;Shuva&quot; [return] and its similarity to the word &quot;teshuva&quot; [repentance], which comes from the same root.). Congregations have different customs regarding the Haftarah on Shabbat Shuvah. Some read all three selections; others recite Hosea and either Joel or Micah (Joel when Shabbat Shuva coincides with Parashat Ha'azinu and Micah when it conincides with Parashat Vayeilech). </p>
