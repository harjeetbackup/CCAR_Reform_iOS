<p><strong>Shacharit Torah Reading Notes </strong><br />
This week's portion contains the reading of the Decalogue (20:2-14). There are two sets of trope for this passage. The Ta'amei Ha'tachton are used for study and divide verses into a more manageable length. The Ta'amei Ha'elyon are used for public reading and give each commandment its own verse. We chant this section of the Torah portion according to the Ta'amei Ha'elyon. For the Ta'amei Ha'Elyon, see RP 476. For more information about the chanting of the Decalogue, and to see the two tropes set side by side, see ATC 78.</p>
