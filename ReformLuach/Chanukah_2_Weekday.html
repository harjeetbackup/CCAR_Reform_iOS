<title>Chanukah 2 Weekday</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Chanukah (Day 2)</h2>
<p>Chanukah begins on the twenty-fifth day of the Hebrew month of Kislev and lasts for eight days. It commemorates the victory of Judah Maccabee and his followers over the forces of the Greco-Syrian tyrant Antiochus Ephiphanes and the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem, which the Syrians had profaned. Chanukah celebrates more than the end of an unsuccessful attempt by an outside power to destroy Judaism. The threat to Judaism was both internal and external. The assimilation to Hellenistic culture was so great that certain elements within Jewish society sought to become fully assimilated, to be accepted as Greek citizens, and to participate in Greek culture at the expense of their own unique Judaic culture. The resistance of the Maccabees and their allies to the blandishments of assimilation preserved Judaism. The story of Chanukah is the age-old struggle of the Jewish people to remain Jewish in a non-Jewish world.</p>
<p><strong>Shacharit<br />
  </strong>In the synagogue, light 2 Chanukah candles, without blessings, before Shacharit.<br />
  Add <em>Al Hanisim</em> for Chanukah (MT 556) to the Amidah (MT 95).<br />
  Recite a full Hallel after the Amidah (MT 560). The Hallel on page 560 is the Half Hallel; congregations that would like to recite a full Hallel should add appropriate selections from Psalms 115 and 116.</p>

</strong>Add <em>Al Hanisim</em> for Chanukah (MT 556) to the Amidah (MT 92)</p>
<p><strong>Candlelighting<br />
  </strong>Light three candles after dark.<br />
  Place the Chanukiyah in a place where it will be visible from the outside. If lighting the candles in the synagogue, place along the southern wall of the synagogue.</p>
<p>Place the appropriate number of candles into the chanukiyah. We begin with one candle on the first night and add another candle each night. We place the first candle on the right end of the chanukiyah, and add a candle to the left each night. We also prepare an additional candle, the shamash.</p>
<p>Light candles as soon after dark as possible. In the synagogue, light either before or after Ma'ariv. First, light the shamash. Then, recite the two Chanukah candle blessings (MT 572). On the first night only, add Shehecheyanu. Then, light the Chanukah candles with the shamash, starting with the newest candle (from left to right).* While lighting the candles, or after lighting them, sing Hanerot Halalu (MT 572) and Maoz Tzur (MT 669).</p>
<p>Candles should burn for at least half an hour.<br />
  There is a custom to light Chanukah candles again, without blessings, before Shacharit in the synagogue. <br />
  On Friday, light Chanukah candles before lighting Shabbat candles.  On Motza'ei Shabbat, light Chanukah candles before making Havdalah in the synagogue, and make Havdalah before lighting candles at home.</p>
<p>* A 1984 CCAR responsum discusses various traditions with respect to the sequence of lighting Chanukah candles.  The author suggests that, in the absence of a different family tradition, we should light from left to right in accordance with general Jewish practice.  For the full text of the responsum, see: <a data-cke-saved-href="http://ccarnet.org/responsa/carr-278-279/" href="http://ccarnet.org/responsa/carr-278-279/">http://ccarnet.org/responsa/carr-278-279/</a></p>
