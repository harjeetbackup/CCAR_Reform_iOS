<h3>Yom HaZikaron</h3>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>On Yom HaZikaron, we remember those soldiers who died in defense of Israel, as well as those who died in terrorist attacks. There is no fixed liturgy for this day. Many communities light a Yartzeit candle and recite El Malei Rachamim and a communal Mourner's Kaddish. Mishkan T'filah includes a service for Yom HaZikaron on MT 534.</p>
