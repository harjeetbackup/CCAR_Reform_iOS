<h3>Shabbat Chol Hamoed</h3>
<h4>Ma'ariv</h4>
<p>Kabbalat Shabbat: We recite an abbreviated Kabbalat Shabbat, consisting of Psalms 92 and 93. Some have the custom of preceding this with a shortened form of L'cha Dodi.</p>
<h4>Birkat Hamazon</h4>
<p>We add Ya'aleh v'Yavo and Harachaman for Sukkot to Birkat Hamazon. We also include R'tzei and Harachaman for Shabbat.</p>
<h4>During Meals</h4>
<p>Recite the blessing over dwelling in the Sukkah.</p>
<p>It is a mitzvah to welcome guests into our Sukkah. Each night of Sukkot, we symbolically welcome some of our patriarchs and matriarchs into our Sukkah as guests. The liturgy of this ceremony can be found in <a href="https://www.ccarpress.org/shopping_product_detail.asp?pid=50141"><em>On the Doorposts of Your House</em></a>, pp. 94-96.</p>
