<h2>Erev Shavuot</h2>
<p>Shavuot occurs on the sixth of the Hebrew month of Sivan. The name Shavuot (meaning “weeks”) derives from its celebration seven weeks (a week of weeks) after Pesach.<br />
  Current observance is based on the Talmudic identification of Shavuot with the events at Sinai. Therefore it is called<em> z’man matan Torateinu</em>, “the season of the giving of the Torah.” On Shavuot, we celebrate our covenantal relationship with God and reafirm our commitment to a Jewish life of study (<em>talmud Torah</em>) and practice (<em>mitzvah</em>). The significance of the events at Sinai derives not only from the receiving of <em>mitzvot</em> but also from their acceptance, as is illustrated in Israel’s response. The ceremony of confirmation (<em>Kabbalat Torah</em>) is a Reform innovation and has added a new dimension to the meaning of the festival. It provides an opportunity for students of post–bar/bat mitzvah age to affirm their relationship to Judaism and the Jewish people. <br />
