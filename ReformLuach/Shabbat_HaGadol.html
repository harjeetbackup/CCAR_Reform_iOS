<h3>Shabbat HaGadol</h3>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>Shabbat HaGadol is the last of the five special Shabbatot that precede Passover, and occurs on the Shabbat before Passover. There are several potential reasons given for naming this the Great Shabbat. Some suggest it is because of the special Haftarah from Malachi we read on this day; it references the &quot;great and terrible day of the Eternal&quot; (3:23) into which the prophet Elijah will lead the people. During the Passover seder, we associate Elijah with the coming of the Messiah.</p>
<h4>Shacharit Haftarah - Traditional</h4>
<p>Malachi 3:4-3:24 (P 1654, RP 1459)</p>
