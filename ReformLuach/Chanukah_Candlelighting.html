<h3>Lighting Chanukah Candles</h3>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>Place the <em>Chanukiyah</em> in a place where it will be visible from the outside. If lighting the candles in the synagogue, place along the southern wall of the synagogue.</p>
<p>Place the appropriate number of candles into the <em>chanukiyah</em>. We begin with one candle on the first night and add another candle each night. We place the first candle on the right end of the <em>chanukiyah</em>, and add a candle to the left each night. We also prepare an additional candle, the shamash.</p>
<p>Light candles as soon after dark as possible. In the synagogue, light either before or after Ma'ariv. First, light the shamash. Then, recite the two Chanukah candle blessings (MT 572). On the first night only, add Shehecheyanu. Then, light the Chanukah candles with the shamash, starting with the newest candle (furthest to the left). While lighting the candles, or after lighting them, sing Hanerot <em>Halalu</em> (MT 572) and <em>Maoz Tzur</em> (MT 669).</p>
<p>Candles should burn for at least half an hour.</p>
<p>There is a custom to light Chanukah candles again, without blessings, before Shacharit in the synagogue. For special instructions for Shabbat Chanukah, look at that day's calendar entry.</p>
