<h2>Erev Sukkot</h2>
<p> Sukkot begins on the  fifteenth of the Hebrew month of Tishrei and concludes on the twenty-second with Sh’mini Atzeret–Simchat Torah. Sukkot is the fall harvest festival. The eighth day, Sh’mini Atzeret, functions as the conclusion of Sukkot but is also a separate festival. Since Reform Jews follow the calendar of the Land of Israel and do not add a ninth day to the festival, we celebrate Simchat Torah and Sh’mini Atzeret on the same day.<br />
More than any other of the Pilgrimage Festivals, Sukkot, also known as <em>HeChag</em>, has retained its agricultural character. However, Sukkot is also the commemoration of a significant event in the life of the Jewish people: the journey through the wilderness toward the Land of Israel. The Torah identifies the <em>sukkah</em> (booth) with the temporary dwellings in which the Israelites lived during that journey (Leviticus 23:42).</p>
<p>It is a mitzvah to welcome guests into our Sukkah. Each night of Sukkot, we symbolically welcome some of our patriarchs and matriarchs into our sukkah as guests. The liturgy of this ceremony can be found in <a href="https://www.ccarpress.org/shopping_product_detail.asp?pid=50141"><em>On the Doorposts of Your House</em></a>, pp. 94-96.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for Sukkot</strong><br />
  Build a Sukkah (for guidelines on building your Sukkah, see JL 113):<br />
  Acquire the 4 species (<em>arba'ah minim</em>). These include an etrog, a lulav, two willow branches (<em>aravah</em>), and three myrtle braches (<em>hadas</em>). It is considered &quot;<em>hiddur Mitzvah</em>&quot; (beautification of the commandment) to acquire a beautiful lulav and etrog.<br />
  The lulav, hadas, and aravah are assembled in their holder as follows: Hold the lulav with the smooth spine toward you and slide in into the middle holder. Place one ring around the holder and one or two rings on the lulav itself to hold the fronds together. Do not place the highest ring less than 4 inches from the tip of the lulav. Place the myrtle branches in the right pocket. Place the willow branches in the left pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Candlelighting<br />
</strong>Light candles before sunset. Recite the candle blessing for festivals and <em>Shehecheyanu</em> (MT 384)</p>
<p><strong>Ma'ariv<br />
  </strong>Recite the festival evening service (MT 348).<br />
  Recite an abbreviated Kabbalat Shabbat, consisting of Psalms 92 and 93. Some also recite a shortened L'cha Dodi before Psalm 92.<br />
Include other changes for Shabbat as marked in the siddur.</p>

<p><strong>During Dinner</strong>
  <br />
Recite the Kiddush for festival evening (MT 386).<br />
Recite the blessing over dwelling the sukkah, as well as <em>Shehecheyanu</em>. We only recite <em>Shehecheyanu</em> our first time eating in the Sukkah.<br />
Add <em>Ya'aleh v'Yavo</em> for Sukkot, <em>Harachaman</em> for Yom Tov, and <em>Harachaman</em> for Sukkot to Birkat Hamazon. Also include R'tzei and Harachaman for Shabbat.</p>
