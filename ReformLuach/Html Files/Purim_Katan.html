    <h2>Purim Katan </h2>
    <p><strong>General Notes<br>
      </strong>In years when there are two months of Adar, we celebrate
      Purim Katan on the 14th day of Adar I. There are no special
      observances on this day, but it should be a day of joy during
      which we celebrate the miracle of Purim. The Mishnah teaches,
      "There is no difference between Adar I and Adar II, except for the
      reading of the <i>M'gilah</i> and the giving of gifts to the
      poor" (BT <i>M'gilah</i> 6b). While we do not perform the Mitzvot
      of Purim on Purim Katan, we should remember and celebrate the
      miracle of Purim.</p>
