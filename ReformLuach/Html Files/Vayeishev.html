    <h2>Parashat Vayeishev</h2>
    <p>Genesis 37:1-40:23</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jacob is shown to favor his son Joseph, whom the other
        brothers resent. Joseph has dreams of grandeur. (Genesis
        37:1-11) </li>
      <li>After Joseph's brothers had gone to tend the flocks in
        Shechem, Jacob sends Joseph to report on them. The brothers
        decide against murdering Joseph but instead sell him into
        slavery. After he is shown Joseph's coat of many colors, which
        had been dipped in the blood of a kid, Jacob is led to believe
        that Joseph has been killed by a beast. (Genesis 37:12-35) </li>
      <li>Tamar successively marries two of Judah's sons, each of whom
        dies. Judah does not permit her levirate marriage to his
        youngest son. She deceives Judah into impregnating her. (Genesis
        38:1-30) </li>
      <li>God is with Joseph in Egypt until the wife of his master,
        Potiphar, accuses him of rape, whereupon Joseph is imprisoned.
        (Genesis 39:1-40:23)</li>
    </ul>
