    <h3>Yom HaShoah V'hag'vurah</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>The 27th of Nisan was designated by the Israeli K'nesset as Yom
      HaShoah, a day to remember those who perished in the Holocaust and
      to honor those who fought in resistance movements. There is no
      fixed liturgy for this day, but most ceremonies do include <i>El
        Malei Rachamim</i> for the victims of the Shoah, as well as a
      communal Mourner's <i>Kaddish</i>. <i>Mishkan T'filah</i>
      includes a service for Yom HaShoah (MT 521), and the Plaut
      commentary suggests Torah and Haftarah readings.</p>
    <h4><i>Shacharit</i> Torah Reading&nbsp;</h4>
