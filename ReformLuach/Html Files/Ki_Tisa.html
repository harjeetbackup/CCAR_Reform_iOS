    <h2>Parashat Ki Tisa</h2>
    <p>Exodus 30:11-34:35</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Moses takes a census of the Israelites and collects a
        half-shekel from each person (30:11-16)</li>
      <li>God tells Moses to construct a water basin and to prepare
        anointing oil and incense for the ordination of the priests.
        Bezalel and Oholiab, skilled artisans, are assigned to make
        objects for the priests and the Tabernacle. (30:17-31:11)</li>
      <li>The Israelites are instructed to keep the Sabbath as a sign of
        their covenant with God. God gives Moses the two tablets of the
        Pact. (31:12-18)</li>
      <li>The Israelites ask Aaron to build them a Golden Calf. Moses
        implores God not to destroy the people and then breaks the two
        tablets of the Pact on which the Ten Commandments are written
        when he sees the idol. God punishes the Israelites by means of a
        plague. (32:1-35)</li>
      <li>Moses goes up the mountain with a blank set of tablets for
        another 40 days so that God will again inscribe the Ten
        Commandments. Other laws, including the edict to observe the
        Pilgrimage Festivals, are also revealed. (34:1-28)</li>
      <li>Moses comes down from the mountain with a radiant face.
        (34:29-35)</li>
    </ul>
