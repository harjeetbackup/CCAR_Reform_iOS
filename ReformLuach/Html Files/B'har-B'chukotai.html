    <h2>Parashot B'har/B'chukotai </h2>
    <p>Leviticus 25:1-27:34</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>God instructs Moses to tell the Israelites that in every
        seventh year, the land shall observe a Sabbath of complete rest:
        Fields should not be sown and vines should not be pruned.
        (25:1-7)</li>
      <li>After forty-nine years, a jubilee year is to be celebrated
        when all the land that had been sold during that time should be
        returned to its original owners and slaves are to be freed.
        (25:8-55)</li>
      <li>God instructs Moses to tell the Israelites not to make idols,
        to keep the Sabbath, and to venerate the sanctuary of the
        Eternal. (26:1-2)</li>
      <li>God promises blessings to the Children of Israel if they
        follow the law and warns about the curses that will befall the
        people if they do not observe God's commandments. (26:1-46)</li>
      <li>Gifts made to the Sanctuary whether by conditional vows or by
        unconditional acts of pious gratitude are discussed. (27:1-34)</li>
    </ul>

    <p> <strong>Torah Reading Notes</strong><br>
      We conclude the book of Leviticus. The final verse of the book is
      chanted with a special melody. As the reader finishes chanting,
      the congregation rises. Before the <em>oleh</em> chants the
      concluding Torah blessing, the congregation chants "<em>Chazak,
        Chazak, V'nitchazek</em>." The Torah reader then chants the same
      words. The <em>oleh</em> then recites the concluding Torah
      blessing. For more detailed instructions and to hear this melody
      chanted, see ATC 81.</p>
