    <h2>Pesach Sheini</h2>
    <p>In Temple times, those who were unable to offer the Passover
      sacrifice at the required time could offer it a month later (see
      Numbers 9:6-12), on the 14th of Iyar. This day was named Pesach
      Sheini. There are no changes to our liturgy on this day, though
      some have the custom to eat a piece of matzah to commemorate it.</p>
