    <h2>Parashat Yitro</h2>
    <p>Exodus 18:1-20:23</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Yitro brings his daughter Zipporah and her two sons, Gershom
        and Eliezer, to his son-in-law Moses. (18:1-12)</li>
      <li>Moses follows Yitro's advice and appoints judges to help him
        lead the people. (18:13-27)</li>
      <li>The Children of Israel camp in front of Mount Sinai. Upon
        hearing the covenant, the Israelites respond, "All that God has
        spoken we will do." (19:1-8)</li>
      <li>After three days of preparation, the Israelites encounter God
        at Mount Sinai. (19:9-25)</li>
      <li>God gives the Ten Commandments aloud directly to the people.
        (20:1-14)</li>
      <li>Frightened, the Children of Israel ask Moses to serve as an
        intermediary between God and them. Moses tells the people not to
        be afraid. (20:15-18)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><i>Shacharit</i> Torah Reading Notes </strong><br>
      This week's portion contains the reading of the Decalogue
      (20:2-14). There are two sets of trope for this passage. The <i>Taamei
        Ha'tachton</i> are used for study and divide verses into a more
      manageable length. The <i>Taamei HaElyon</i> are used for public
      reading and give each commandment its own verse. We chant this
      section of the Torah portion according to the <i>Taamei HaElyon</i>.
      For the <i>Taamei HaElyon</i>, see RP 476. For more information
      about the chanting of the Decalogue, and to see the two tropes set
      side by side, see ATC 78.</p>
