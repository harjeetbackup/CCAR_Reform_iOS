      Shabbat Nachamu</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>Shabbat Nachamu is named for the first word of this week's
      Haftarah.</p>
         <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Moses pleads with God to let him enter the Land of Israel with
        the people, but God once more refuses his request. (3:23–28)</li>
      <li>Moses orders the Children of Israel to pay attention and
        follow the laws given by God in order to be worthy of the land
        they are about to receive. (4:1–40)</li>
      <li>Specific areas of the land are set aside to serve as cities of
        refuge. (4:41–43)</li>
      <li>The covenant at Sinai and the Ten Commandments are recalled.
        Once again, the people are exhorted to heed God’s commandments.
        (5:1–30)</li>
      <li>Moses speaks the words of the <i>Sh’ma</i>, the credo of
        Judaism, and commands Israel to show their love for <i>Adonai</i>
        and keep God’s laws and ordinances. (6:1–25)</li>
      <li>Moses warns the people not to commit idolatry by worshiping
        the gods of the nations they will conquer in Israel. (7:1–11)</li>

    <h4><i>Shacharit </i>Torah Reading Notes</h4>
    <p>This week's portion contains the reading of the Decalogue
      (4:6-18). There are two sets of trope for this passage. The <i>Taamei
        HaTachton</i> are used for study and divide verses into a more
      manageable length. The <em>Taamei HaElyon</em> are used for
      public reading and give each commandment its own verse. We chant
      this section of the Torah portion according to the <em>Taamei
        HaElyon</em>. For the <em>Taamei HaElyon</em>, see RP 1196. For
      more information about the chanting of the Decalogue, and to see
      the two tropes set side by side, see ATC 78.</p>
