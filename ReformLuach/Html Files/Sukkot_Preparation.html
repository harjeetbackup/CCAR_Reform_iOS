    <h3>Preparing for Sukkot</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>Build a Sukkah (for guidelines on building your Sukkah, see JL
      113):</p>
    <p>Acquire the four species (<i>arbaah minim</i>). These include an
      <i>etrog</i>, a <i>lulav</i>, two willow branches (<i>aravah</i>),
      and three myrtle branches (<i>hadas</i>). It is considered "<i>hidur
        mitzvah</i>" (beautification of the commandment) to acquire a
      beautiful <i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i>lulav</i>, <i>hadas</i>, and <i>aravah</i> are
      assembled in their holder as follows: Hold the <i>lulav</i> with
      the smooth spine toward you and slide in into the middle holder.
      Place one ring around the holder and one or two rings on the <i>lulav</i>
      itself to hold the fronds together. Do not place the highest ring
      less than four inches from the tip of the <i>lulav</i>. Place the
      myrtle branches in the right pocket. Place the willow branches in
      the left pocket.</p>
