    <h3>Yom HaZikaron</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>On Yom HaZikaron, we remember those soldiers who died in defense
      of Israel, as well as those who died in terrorist attacks. There
      is no fixed liturgy for this day. Many communities light a <i>Yahrtzeit
      </i>candle and recite <i>El Malei Rachamim</i> and a communal
      Mourner's Kaddish. <i>Mishkan T'filah</i> includes a service for
      Yom HaZikaron on MT 534.</p>
