    <h2>Erev Rosh HaShanah</h2>
    <p>Rosh HaShanah, which falls on the first of the Hebrew month of
      Tishrei, marks the beginning of the new year. It is, however, far
      more than the first day of the calendar year. It is the beginning
      of a ten-day period of rigorous introspection and self-examination
      that continues through Yom Kippur. So important did the Rabbis
      consider this period, that they proclaimed the whole of the
      preceding month of Elul as a period of preparation.</p>
    <p><strong>General Notes </strong><br>
      It is customary for synagogues to replace the Torah cover, <em>Parochet</em>
      (curtain covering the Ark), and cover of the reading table with
      white ones until after Yom Kippur.<br>
      It is customary to visit the graves of loved ones on this day. </p>
    <p><i><strong>Shacharit </strong></i><br>
      We do not sound the shofar during Shacharit. <br>
      Conclude the service with <em>Achat Shaalti</em> (MT 662). </p>
    <p><strong>Candlelighting </strong><br>
      Light candles before sunset. <br>
      Recite&nbsp;the festival candle blessing and <em>Shehecheyanu</em>
      (MT 384).</p>
    <p><strong>During Dinner </strong><br>
      We recite the <i>Kiddush</i> for Rosh Hashanah evening, followed
      by <em>Shehecheyanu</em>.<br>
      Before making <i>HaMotzi</i>, dip an apple in honey and recite
      the following: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="direction:rtl; text-align:left">יְהִי רָצוֹן
        מִלְּפָנֶֽיךָ‚ יְיָ אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ וֵאלֹהֵי אֲבוֹתֵֽינוּ
        וְאִמּוֹתֵֽינוּ‚ שֶׁתְּחַדֵּשׁ עָלֵֽינוּ שָׁנָה טוֹבָה
        וּמְתוּקָה.</p>
      <p> <em>Y’hi ratzon mil’fanecha, Adonai Eloheinu v’Elohei
          avoteinu v’imoteinu, shet’chadeish aleinu shanah tovah
          umtukah!</em></p>
      <p>Our God and God of our ancestors, Eternal God of all
        generations: <br>
        May Your presence in our lives this New Year renew our spirits
        and renew our strength.<br>
        May it be a good year. May it be a sweet year. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Then, recite the blessing over fruit and eat the apple.<br>
      We then make<i> HaMotzi</i> over two challot. It is customary to
      eat round challot during this season. Some people sprinkle honey
      over their challah rather than salt. <br>
      We add <em>Yaaleh v'Yavo</em> and <em>Harachaman</em> for Rosh
      HaShanah to <em>Birkat HaMazon</em>.</p>
