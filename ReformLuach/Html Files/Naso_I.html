    <p><strong>Splitting the <i>Parashah</i><br>
      </strong><em>While describing a different </em>parashah<em>, this
        rational is applicable:<br>
      </em>Why do we do this? It is one of the rare examples where the
      lectionary (cycle of Torah readings) in the Reform Movement
      differs from that of the rest of the Jewish world. In the rest of
      the Diaspora, festivals are observed for two days (stemming from
      the time before the calendar was fixed), so
      the&nbsp;Shabbat&nbsp;that is considered to be the eighth day of
      Passover (that is, the second day of the conclusion of the
      festival), on which a special Torah portion is read (Deuteronomy
      14:22-16:17). But because the calendar has been fixed for
      millennia, the Reform Movement has never observed the second day
      of festivals. So for us, it is a regular Shabbat when we continue
      the cycle of Torah readings with&nbsp;<em>Sh'mini&nbsp;</em>(Leviticus
      9:1-11:47). The problem is that if on the&nbsp;<em>following&nbsp;</em>week
      we were to read the next portion,&nbsp;<em>Tazria/M'tzora,&nbsp;</em>we
      would be completely out of sync with the rest of the Jewish world,
      which would be reading&nbsp;<em>Sh'mini.&nbsp;</em>Striving to
      balance Reform festival practice with our simultaneous commitment
      to&nbsp;<em>K'lal Yisrael,&nbsp;</em>"the whole community of
      Israel," the Movement decided to split the&nbsp;<em>Sh'mini&nbsp;</em>portion
      in two, reading&nbsp;<em>Sh'mini I</em>&nbsp;when the rest of the
      Jewish world reads the eighth day of Pesach portion, and&nbsp;<em>Sh'mini
        II,&nbsp;</em>the other half, the following week, joining the
      rest of the Jewish world in the same Torah reading.</p>
