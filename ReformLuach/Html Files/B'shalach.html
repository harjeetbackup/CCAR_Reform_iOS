    <p><strong>General Notes</strong><br>
      <i>Parashat B'shalach</i> is called Shabbat Shirah because it
      includes <i>Shirat HaYam</i>, or the Song of the Sea. The
      Israelites sing <i>Shirat HaYam</i> to celebrate crossing the Sea
      of Reeds and to praise God for subduing the Egyptians. </p>
    <p><strong>Shacharit </strong><br>
      We sing a special melody for parts of <i>Shirat HaYam</i>
      (15:1-19). Part or all of each of the following verses is chanted
      to the special melody: 15:1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 16, 18. 15:21 is also
      chanted to the <i>Shirat HaYam</i> melody. Some congregations
      have the custom for the reader to chant each phrase and for the
      congregation to repeat that phrase or to respond with the next
      phrase. For the Shirat HaYam melody, see ATC 76. </p>
