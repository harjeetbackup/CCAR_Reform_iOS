<h3>Shavuot Day 2 (Diaspora)</h3>
<p>Most Reform congregations do not observe the second festival day.  Regarding the observance of a second festival day, Mark Washofsky writes, “Reform Jews have . . . returned to the standard, as prescribed by the Torah, that each <em>Yom Tov</em> be observed for one day.”  For more information, see JL pp.93-95.  Practices for the second festival day are included here, in recognition of some congregations who do observe an additional day.</p>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
Shavuot occurs on the sixth of the Hebrew month of Sivan. The name Shavuot (meaning “weeks”) derives from its celebration seven weeks (a week of weeks) after Pesach.
Current observance is based on the Talmudic identification of Shavuot with the events at Sinai. Therefore it is called <em>z’man matan Torateinu</em>, “the season of the giving of the Torah.” On Shavuot, we celebrate our covenantal relationship with God and reaffirm our commitment to a Jewish life of study (<em>talmud Torah</em>) and practice (mitzvah). The significance of the events at Sinai derives not only from the receiving of mitzvot but also from their acceptance, as is illustrated in Israel’s response. The ceremony of confirmation (<em>Kabbalat Torah</em>) is a Reform innovation and has added a new dimension to the meaning of the festival. It provides an opportunity for students of post–bar/bat mitzvah age to affirm their relationship to Judaism and the Jewish people. 
<h4><em>Shacharit</em></h4>
Recite festival morning service (MT 414) [on Shabbat include appropriate additions].<br>
Recite festival <em>Amidah</em> with appropriate additions for Pesach [and Shabbat] (MT 468).<br>
After the <em>Amidah</em>, recite a full <em>Hallel</em> (MT 560). The <em>Hallel</em> on page 560 is the half <em>Hallel</em>; congregations that would like to recite a full <em>Hallel</em> should add appropriate selections from Psalms 115 and 116.<br>
Before the Torah service, chant the book of Ruth (for congregations observing a second day of Shavuot, this would be instead of chanting it on the first day).<br>
We recite the Torah service for festivals (MT 494). We recite the Thirteen Attributes (MT 496) three times.<br>
[Historically, some congregations do not recite the Thirteen Attributes on Shabbat.]
