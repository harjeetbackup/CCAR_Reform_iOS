    <h3>Lighting Chanukah Candles</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>Place the <em>chanukiyah</em> in a place where it will be
      visible from the outside. If lighting the candles in the
      synagogue, place along the southern wall of the synagogue.</p>
    <p>Place the appropriate number of candles into the <em>chanukiyah</em>.
      We begin with one candle on the first night and add another candle
      each night. We place the first candle on the right end of the <em>chanukiyah</em>,
      and add a candle to the left each night. We also prepare an
      additional candle, the <i>shamash</i>.</p>
    <p>Light candles as soon after dark as possible. In the synagogue,
      light either before or after <i>Maariv</i>. First, light the <i>shamash</i>.
      Then, recite the two Chanukah candle blessings (MT 572). On the
      first night only, add <i>Shehecheyanu</i>. Then, light the
      Chanukah candles with the <i>shamash</i>, starting with the
      newest candle (furthest to the left). While lighting the candles,
      or after lighting them, sing <i>Hanerot</i> <em>Halalu</em> (MT
      572) and <em>Maoz Tzur</em> (MT 669).</p>
    <p>Candles should burn for at least half an hour.</p>
    <p>There is a custom to light Chanukah candles again, without
      blessings, before <i>Shacharit</i> in the synagogue. For special
      instructions for Shabbat Chanukah, look at that day's calendar
      entry.</p>
