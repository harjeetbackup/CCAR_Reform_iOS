    <h2>Parashat Korach </h2>
    <p>Numbers 16:1-18:32</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Korach and his followers, Dathan and Abiram, lead a rebellion
        against the leadership of Moses and Aaron. God punishes the
        rebels by burying them and their families alive. Once again, God
        brings a plague on the people. (16:1-17:15)</li>
      <li>The chief of each tribe deposits his staff inside the Tent of
        Meeting. Aaron's staff brings forth sprouts, produces blossoms,
        and bears almonds. (17:16-26)</li>
      <li>The <i>Kohanim</i> and Levites are established and assigned
        the responsibility of managing the donations to the Sanctuary.
        All of the firstborn offerings shall go to the priests and all
        the tithes are designated for the Levites in return for the
        services they perform. (18:1-32)</li>
    </ul>
