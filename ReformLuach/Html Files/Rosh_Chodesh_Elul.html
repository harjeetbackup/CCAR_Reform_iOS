<h3>Month of Elul</h3>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>Each day, Psalm 27 is historically recited at the end of the Shacharit and Ma'ariv services. One verse of Psalm 27, <em>Achat Sha'alti</em>, is included in Mishkan T'filah (MT 662). We continue reciting <em>Achat Sha'alti</em> through Hoshanah Rabah or Sh'mini Atzeret/Simchat Torah.</p>
<p>On weekdays, the shofar is sounded during the shacharit service after the recitation of Psalm 27. No blessing is recited. We sound T'kiah, followed by Sh'varim, T'ruah, and another T'kiah. The shofar is not historically sounded on Shabbat or on the morning of Erev Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p>There is a custom to increase the giving of Tzedakah during this month (JL 117).</p>
