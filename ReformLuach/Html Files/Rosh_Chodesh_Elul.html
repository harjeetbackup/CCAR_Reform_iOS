        <h3>Month of Elul</h3>
        <h4>General Notes</h4>
        <p>Each day, Psalm 27 is historically recited at the end of the <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em> services. One verse of Psalm 27, <em>Achat Sha'alti</em>, is included in Mishkan T'filah (MT 662). We continue reciting <em>Achat Sha'alti</em> through <em>Hoshanah Rabah</em> or <em>Sh'mini Atzeret/Simchat Torah</em>.</p>
        <p>On weekdays, the shofar is sounded during the <em>shacharit</em> service after the recitation of Psalm 27. No blessing is recited. We sound <em>T'kiah</em>, followed by <em>Sh'varim, T'ruah,</em> and another <em>T'kiah</em>. The shofar is not historically sounded on Shabbat or on the morning of <em>Erev</em> Rosh Hashanah.</p>
        <p>There is a custom to increase the giving of <em>Tzedakah</em> during this month (JL 117).</p>
