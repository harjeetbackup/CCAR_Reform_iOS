    <h3>Shabbat HaGadol</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>Shabbat HaGadol is the last of the five special Shabbatot that
      precede Passover, and occurs on the Shabbat before Passover. There
      are several potential reasons given for naming this the Great
      Shabbat. Some suggest it is because of the special Haftarah from
      Malachi we read on this day; it references the "great and terrible
      day of the Eternal" (3:23) into which the prophet Elijah will lead
      the people. During the Passover seder, we associate Elijah with
      the coming of the Messiah.</p>
