    <h2>Parashat B'haalot'cha</h2>
    <p>Numbers 8:1-12:16</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>God speaks to Moses, describing the menorah for the Tent of
        Meeting. The Levites are appointed to serve as assistants under
        Aaron and his sons. (8:1-26)</li>
      <li>Those who are unable to celebrate Passover during Nisan are
        given a time in the month of Sivan to observe a "second
        Passover." (9:1-14)</li>
      <li>A cloud by day and fire by night show God's Presence over the
        Tabernacle. When the cloud lifts from the Tabernacle, the people
        leave Sinai, setting out on their journey, tribe by tribe.
        (9:15-10:36)</li>
      <li>The Israelites complain about the lack of meat, and Moses
        becomes frustrated. God tells him to appoint a council of
        elders. God provides the people with meat and then strikes them
        with a very severe plague. (11:1-34)</li>
      <li>Miriam and Aaron talk about the "Cushite woman" whom Moses has
        married. In addition, they complain that God speaks not only
        through Moses but also through them. Miriam is struck with
        leprosy, and Moses begs God to heal her. After her recovery, the
        people resume their journey. (12:1-16)</li>
    </ul>
