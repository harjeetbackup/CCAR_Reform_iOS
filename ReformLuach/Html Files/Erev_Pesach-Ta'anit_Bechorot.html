    <h2>Taanit B'chorot<br>
      Pesach (Begins at sundown)</h2>
    <p>Pesach, which begins on the fifteenth of the Hebrew month of
      Nisan and lasts for seven days, commemorates the Exodus from
      Egypt.<br>
      While current Pesach observance draws some of its symbolism from
      the agricultural and pastoral origins of the festival, it is
      primarily a celebration of the Exodus from Egypt. The liberation
      of the Jewish people from Egyptian bondage has become a powerful
      symbol of redemptionâ€”not only the redemption of the Jewish people,
      but the redemption of the entire world. The <a
        href="https://www.ccarpress.org/shopping_product_list.asp?catID=3800">Haggadah</a>,
      reflecting the historical experience of the Jewish people,
      recognizes that slavery is not limited to physical bondage, but
      that spiritual slavery and social degradation are no less potent
      methods of depriving human beings of liberty.</p>
    <p><strong>General Notes<br>
      </strong><em>Chameitz</em> may only be eaten during the early part
      of the day. Check with your rabbi for the exact time at which you
      should stop eating <em>chameitz</em>.<br>
      Historically, first-born fast on this day. <i>Taanit B'chorot</i>
      recognizes that the first-born children of the Israelites were
      saved when the first-born children of the Egyptians were killed.
