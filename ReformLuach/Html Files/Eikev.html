    <h2>Parashat Eikev </h2>
    <p>Deuteronomy 7:12-11:2</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Moses tells the Israelites that if they follow God's laws, the
        nations who now dwell across the Jordan River will not harm
        them. (7:12–26)</li>
      <li>Moses reminds the people of the virtues of keeping God's
        commandments. He also tells them that they will dispossess those
        who now live in the Land only because they are idolatrous, not
        because the Israelites are uncommonly virtuous. Thereupon, Moses
        reviews all of the trespasses of the Israelites against God.
        (8:1–10:11)</li>
      <li>Moses says that the Land of Israel will overflow with milk and
        honey if the people obey God's commandments and teach them to
        their children. (10:12–11:25)</li>
    </ul>
