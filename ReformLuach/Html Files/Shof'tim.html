    <h2>Parashat Shof'tim </h2>
    <p>Deuteronomy 16:18-21:9</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Laws regarding both sacred and secular legislation are
        addressed. The Israelites are told that in every dealing they
        should pursue justice in order to merit the land that God is
        giving them. (16:18–18:8)</li>
      <li>The people are warned to avoid sorcery and witchcraft, the
        abhorrent practices of their idolatrous neighbors. (18:9–22)</li>
      <li>God tells them that should an Israelite unintentionally kill
        another, he may take sanctuary in any of three designated cities
        of refuge. (19:1–13)</li>
      <li>Laws to be followed during times of peace and times of war are
        set forth. (19:14–21:9)</li>
    </ul>
