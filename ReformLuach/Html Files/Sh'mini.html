    <h2>Parashat Sh'mini </h2>
    <p>Leviticus 9:1-11:47</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aaron and his sons follow Moses's instructions and offer
        sacrifices so that God will forgive the people. (9:1-24)</li>
      <li>Two of Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, offer "alien fire" to
        God. God punishes these two priests by killing them immediately.
        (10:1-3)</li>
      <li>God forbids Moses, Aaron, and his surviving sons from mourning
        but commands the rest of the people to do so. Priests are told
        not to drink alcohol before entering the sacred Tabernacle and
        are further instructed about making sacrifices. (10:4-20)</li>
      <li>Laws are given to distinguish between pure and impure animals,
        birds, fish, and insects. (11:1-47)</li>
    </ul>
