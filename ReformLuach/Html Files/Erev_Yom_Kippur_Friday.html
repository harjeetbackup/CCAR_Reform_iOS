    <h2>Erev Yom Kippur</h2>
    <p>Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, occurs on the tenth of Tishrei
      (Leviticus 23:27). It is the culmination of the Ten Days of
      Repentance. It alone of all the Jewish holidays is the equivalent
      of Shabbat in sanctity. Its mood is reflective and introspective—a
      day devoted totally to personal and communal self-examination,
      confession, and atonement. Yom Kippur provides us with the
      opportunity to alter our conduct, readjust our values, and set
      things right in our lives. The day demands absolute honesty as we
      confess our wrongdoings: “We have gone astray, we have sinned, we
      have transgressed.” The grandeur of the liturgy and music adds to
      the drama and seriousness of the day. From <em>Kol Nidrei</em>,
      the eve of Yom Kippur, to the last triumphant note of the shofar
      at the conclusion of the <em>N’ilah</em> service, its purpose is
      to move us toward reconciliation with God and our fellow human
      beings and to aid us to do better in the coming year.</p>
    <p><strong>General Notes<br>
      </strong>We ask forgiveness from others in preparation for Yom
      Kippur.<br>
      Some have the tradition of immersing in a <i>mikveh</i> in
      preparation for Yom Kippur.<br>
    </p>
    <p><i><strong>Shacharit</strong></i> <br>
      Omit Psalm 100 (MT 104)<br>
      When reciting every Kaddish, after the word "<em>l'eilah</em>," we
      add "<em>u'l'eilah</em>."<br>
      When reciting the <i>Amidah</i>, include passages marked,
      "Between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur".<br>
      Conclude the service with <em>Achat Shaalti</em> (MT 662)</p>
    <p><strong>Candlelighting<br>
      </strong>Light candles before sunset. Recite the candle blessing
      for Yom Kippur, as well as <em>Shehecheyanu</em>. </p>
    <p><i><strong>Maariv</strong></i> <br>
      <i>Kol Nidrei</i>:<br>
      We wear tallot for the <i>Kol Nidrei</i> service.<br>
      It is customary to wear white for all Yom Kippur services. Some
      wear a <i>kitel</i>.<br>
      We recite an abbreviated <i>Kabbalat Shabbat</i>, consisting of
      Psalms 92 and 93. Some congregations also recite a shortened form
      of <i>L'chah Dodi</i> before Psalm 92.<br>
      Include other changes for Shabbat as marked in the machzor.</p>
    <p><strong>During Dinner<br>
      </strong>In the afternoon, before Yom Kippur begins, it is a
      mitzvah to eat a <em>S'udah Mafseket</em>. This should be a
      festive and satisfying meal, beginning with <i>HaMotzi </i>and
      concluding with a weekday <i>Birkat HaMazon</i>. We finish the
      meal before sundown, and we light our candles. This meal is not
      only in preparation for the fast to follow, but also to express
      our hopes that our Yom Kippur observance will lead us to a good
      new year (JL 123). Our tradition teaches us that, just as it is a
      mitzvah to fast on Yom Kippur, it is also a mitzvah to eat the day
      before Yom Kippur. It should be a festive meal, as Erev Yom Kippur
      is considered a partially festive day: we express our confidence
      that God with treat us mercifully this Yom Kippur.</p>
