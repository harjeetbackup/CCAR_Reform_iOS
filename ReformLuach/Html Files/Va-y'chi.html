    <p>Genesis 47:28-50:26</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jacob blesses his grandchildren Ephraim and Manasseh.
        (48:1-20)</li>
      <li>Jacob's twelve sons gather around his deathbed, and each
        receives an evaluation and a prediction of his future. (49:1-33)</li>
      <li>Joseph mourns his father's death and has Jacob embalmed. Jacob
        is buried in Hebron in the cave of the field of the Machpelah in
        the land of Canaan. (50:1-14)</li>
      <li>Joseph assures his concerned brothers that he has forgiven
        them and promises to care for them and their families.
        (50:15-21)</li>
      <li>Just before he dies, Joseph tells his brothers that God will
        return them to the Land that God promised to the patriarchs. The
        Children of Israel promise Joseph that they will take his bones
        with them when they leave Egypt. (50:22-26)</li>

    <p><strong><i>Shacharit</i> Torah Reading Notes </strong><br>
      We conclude the book of Genesis. The final verse of the book is
      chanted with a special melody. As the reader finishes chanting,
      the congregation rises. Before the <em>oleh</em> chants the
      concluding Torah blessing, the congregation chants "<em>Chazak,
        Chazak, V'nitchazek</em>." The Torah reader then chants the same
      words. The <em>oleh</em> then recites the concluding Torah
      blessing. For more detailed instructions and to hear this melody
      chanted, see ATC 81. </p>
