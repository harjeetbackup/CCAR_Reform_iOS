    <h2>Parashat Ki Tavo </h2>
    <p>Deuteronomy 26:1-29:8</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Israelites are instructed to express their gratitude to
        God for their bountiful harvests and freedom from slavery by
        tithing ten percent of their crops for the Levite, the stranger,
        the orphan, and the widow. (26)</li>
      <li>The people are told to display on large stones God's
        commandments for all to see. (27:1-8)</li>
      <li>The Levites are to proclaim curses upon those who violate
        God's commandments. (27:15-26)</li>
      <li>The Israelites are told that if they obey God's mitzvot
        faithfully, they will receive every blessing imaginable. They
        are also told that if do not fulfill their <i>b'rit</i> with
        God, many curses will descend upon them. (28:1-69)</li>
      <li>Moses reminds the Israelites of the miracles they witnessed in
        the wilderness and commands them to observe the terms of the
        covenant so that they may succeed in all that they undertake.
        (29:1-8)</li>
    </ul>
