    <p><strong>Torah Reading Notes</strong><br>
      We conclude the book of Numbers. The final verse of the book is
      chanted with a special melody. As the reader finishes chanting,
      the congregation rises. Before the <em>oleh</em> chants the
      concluding Torah blessing, the congregation chants "<em>Chazak,
        Chazak, V'nitchazek.</em>" The Torah reader then chants the same
      words. The <em>oleh</em> then recites the concluding Torah
      blessing. For more detailed instructions and to hear this melody
      chanted, see ATC 81. </p>
