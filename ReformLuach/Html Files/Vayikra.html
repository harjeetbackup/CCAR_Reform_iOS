    <h2>Parashat Vayikra</h2>
    <p>Leviticus 1:1-5:26</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <p>God instructs Moses on the five different kinds of sacrifices
      that were to be offered in the sanctuary:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The&nbsp;<em>olah</em>&nbsp;or "burnt offering" was a
        voluntary sacrifice that had a high degree of sanctity and was
        regarded as the "standard" offering. The entire animal, except
        for its hide, was burned on the altar. (1:1-17)</li>
      <li>The&nbsp;<em>minchah&nbsp;</em>or "meal offering" was a
        sacrifice made of flour, oil, salt, and frankincense that was
        partly burned on the altar and partly given to the priests to
        eat. (2:1-16)</li>
      <li>The&nbsp;<em>zevach sh'lamim&nbsp;</em>or "sacrifice of
        well-being" was a voluntary animal offering from one's herd,
        sometimes brought to fulfill a vow. (3:1-17)</li>
      <li>The&nbsp;<em>chatat&nbsp;</em>or "sin offering" was an
        obligatory sacrifice that was offered to expiate unintentional
        sins. This offering differs from the others in the special
        treatment of the blood of the animal. (4:1-5:13)</li>
      <li>The&nbsp;<em>asham&nbsp;</em>or "penalty offering" was an
        obligatory sacrifice of a ram that was required chiefly of one
        who had misappropriated property. (5:1-26) </li>
    </ul>
