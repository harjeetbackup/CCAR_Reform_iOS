<h3>Rosh Chodesh Av</h3>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>Historically, people take on additional mourning practices in the nine days between Rosh Chodesh Av and Tisha b'Av. These practices include not eating meat or drinking wine and not cutting one's hair. All mourning practices are suspended on Shabbat. For a Reform perspective on this period, see JL 129-130.</p>
