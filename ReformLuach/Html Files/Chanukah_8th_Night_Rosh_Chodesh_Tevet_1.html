    <h2>Chanukah (Day 7)<br>
      Rosh Chodesh Tevet</h2>
    <p>Chanukah begins on the twenty-fifth day of the Hebrew month of
      Kislev and lasts for eight days. It commemorates the victory of
      Judah Maccabee and his followers over the forces of the
      Greco-Syrian tyrant Antiochus Ephiphanes and the rededication of
      the Temple in Jerusalem, which the Syrians had profaned. Chanukah
      celebrates more than the end of an unsuccessful attempt by an
      outside power to destroy Judaism. The threat to Judaism was both
      internal and external. The assimilation to Hellenistic culture was
      so great that certain elements within Jewish society sought to
      become fully assimilated, to be accepted as Greek citizens, and to
      participate in Greek culture at the expense of their own unique
      Judaic culture. The resistance of the Maccabees and their allies
      to the blandishments of assimilation preserved Judaism. The story
      of Chanukah is the age-old struggle of the Jewish people to remain
      Jewish in a non-Jewish world.</p>
    <p><strong><i>Shacharit</i><br>
      </strong>In the synagogue, light seven Chanukah candles, without
      blessings, before <i>Shacharit</i>.<br>
      Add <em>Al Hanisim</em> for Chanukah (MT 556) to the <i>Amidah</i>
      (MT 95).<br>
      Recite a full <i>Hallel</i> after the <i>Amidah</i> (MT 560).
      The <i>Hallel </i>on page 560 is the half <i>Hallel</i>;
      congregations that would like to recite a full <i>Hallel </i>should

      add appropriate selections from Psalms 115 and 116.</p>

    <p><strong>Candlelighting</strong><br>
      <p>Light <strong>eight</strong> candles after dark.</p>
      Place the <i>chanukiyah</i> in a place where it will be visible
      from the outside. If lighting the candles in the synagogue, place
      along the southern wall of the synagogue.</p>
    <p>Place the appropriate number of candles into the <i>chanukiyah</i>.
      We begin with one candle on the first night and add another candle
      each night. We place the first candle on the right end of the <i>chanukiyah</i>,
      and add a candle to the left each night. We also prepare an
      additional candle, the <i>shamash</i>.</p>
    <p>Light candles as soon after dark as possible. In the synagogue,
      light either before or after <i>Maariv.</i> First, light the <i>shamash</i>.
      Then, recite the two Chanukah candle blessings (MT 572). On the
      first night only, add <i>Shehecheyanu</i>. Then, light the
      Chanukah candles with the <i>shamash</i>, starting with the
      newest candle (furthest to the left).* &nbsp;While lighting the
      candles, or after lighting them, sing <i>Hanerot Halalu</i> (MT
      572) and <i>Maoz Tzur</i> (MT 669).</p>
    <p>Candles should burn for at least half an hour.</p>
    <p>There is a custom to light Chanukah candles again, without
      blessings, before <i>Shacharit</i> in the synagogue.<br>
      On Friday, light Chanukah candles before lighting Shabbat
      candles.&nbsp; On <i>Motza'ei Shabbat</i>, light Chanukah candles
      before making <i>Havdalah</i> in the synagogue, and make <i>Havdalah</i>
      before lighting candles at home.</p>
    <p>* A 1984 CCAR responsum discusses various traditions with respect
      to the sequence of lighting Chanukah candles. &nbsp;The author
      suggests that, in the absence of a different family tradition, we
      should light from left to right in accordance with general Jewish
      practice. &nbsp;For the full text of the responsum, see:<a
