    <h2>Erev Shavuot</h2>
    <p>Shavuot occurs on the sixth of the Hebrew month of Sivan. The
      name Shavuot (meaning “weeks”) derives from its celebration seven
      weeks (a week of weeks) after Pesach.<br>
      Current observance is based on the Talmudic identification of
      Shavuot with the events at Sinai. Therefore it is called<em> z’man
        matan Torateinu</em>, “the season of the giving of the Torah.”
      On Shavuot, we celebrate our covenantal relationship with God and
      reaffirm our commitment to a Jewish life of study (<em>talmud
        Torah</em>) and practice (mitzvah). The significance of the
      events at Sinai derives not only from the receiving of mitzvot but
      also from their acceptance, as is illustrated in Israel’s
      response. The ceremony of confirmation (<em>Kabbalat Torah</em>)
      is a Reform innovation and has added a new dimension to the
      meaning of the festival. It provides an opportunity for students
      of post–bar/bat mitzvah age to affirm their relationship to
      Judaism and the Jewish people. <br>

    <p><strong>General Notes<br>

      many have the custom of studying Torah through the night.</p>
    <p><strong>Candlelighting<br>
      </strong>Before dark, light candles. Recite the festival candle
      blessing and <i>S</i><i>hehecheyanu </i>(MT 384).</p>
    <p><strong><i>Maariv</i><br>
      </strong>Recite festival evening service (MT 384).<br>
      Recite festival <i>Amidah</i> with appropriate additions for
      Shavuot (MT 468).</p>
    <p><strong>During Dinner<br>
      </strong>Recite festival evening <i>Kiddush</i> (MT 386).<br>
      Many have the custom of eating dairy meals on Shavuot.<br>
