    <h3>B'dikat and Biur Chameitz</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>The evening before Pesach (or the Thursday night before Pesach
      when Pesach begins on Saturday night), we search for <i>chameitz</i>
      in our homes as soon as possible after dark. We place pieces of <i>chameitz</i>
      in different areas of our house, in order to ensure that there is
      some <i>chameitz</i> to find during our search. We search
      darkened rooms by the light of a flashlight or candle. The
      procedure is as follows:</p>
    <p>1. Recite the blessing before searching for <i>chameitz</i>,
      which concludes with "<i>al biur chameitz</i>." (The full blessing
      can be found at the beginning of most Haggadot.)</p>
    <p>2. Collect the pieces of <i>chameitz</i> you set aside, as well
      as any other <i>chameitz</i> you find in the process of
      searching.</p>
    <p>3. Recite the formula by which you renounce ownership over any <i>chameitz
      </i>you have inadvertently left in your house. (The formula begins
      with "<i>Kol chamira</i>..." and can be found at the beginning of
      most Haggadot.)</p>
    <p>4. Set aside the <i>chameitz</i> you found during your search
      until the morning.</p>
    <p>5. The following morning, before the time at which it becomes
      forbidden to eat <i>chameitz</i>, we destroy the <i>chameitz</i>
      that remains in our possession. Many destroy their <i>chameitz</i>
      by burning it, though it is permissible to destroy or dispose of
      it in other ways (as long as it does not remain in your home).
      After destroying the <i>chameitz</i>, we recite another passage
      renouncing ownership over any <i>chameitz</i> that we have
      inadvertently kept in our homes (The formula begins "<i>kol
        chamira</i>" and can be found at the beginning of most
      Haggadot). &nbsp;When Pesach begins on Saturday night, <i>Biur
        Chameitz </i>is done on Friday without reciting this formula.</p>
    <p>*When Pesach begins on Saturday night, make sure to leave enough
      <i>chameitz</i> for Shabbat. &nbsp;</p>
