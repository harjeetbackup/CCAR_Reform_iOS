    </h2>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Moses pleads with God to let him enter the Land of Israel with
        the people, but God once more refuses his request. (3:23–28)</li>
      <li>Moses orders the Children of Israel to pay attention and
        follow the laws given by God in order to be worthy of the land
        they are about to receive. (4:1–40)</li>
      <li>Specific areas of the land are set aside to serve as cities of
        refuge. (4:41–43)</li>
      <li>The covenant at Sinai and the Ten Commandments are recalled.
        Once again, the people are exhorted to heed God’s commandments.
        (5:1–30)</li>
      <li>Moses speaks the words of the <i>Sh’ma</i>, the credo of
        Judaism, and commands Israel to show their love for <i>Adonai</i>
        and keep God’s laws and ordinances. (6:1–25)</li>
      <li>Moses warns the people not to commit idolatry by worshiping
        the gods of the nations they will conquer in Israel. (7:1–11)</li>

    <p><strong><i>Shacharit</i> Torah Reading Notes </strong><br>
      This week's portion contains the reading of the Decalogue
      (4:6-18). There are two sets of trope for this passage. The <i>Taamei
        Ha'tachton</i> are used for study and divide verses into a more
      manageable length. The <i>Taamei HaElyon</i> are used for public
      reading and give each commandment its own verse. We chant this
      section of the Torah portion according to the <i>Taamei HaElyon</i>.
      For the <i>Taamei HaElyon</i>, see RP 1196. For more information
      about the chanting of the Decalogue, and to see the two tropes set
      side by side, see ATC 78.</p>
