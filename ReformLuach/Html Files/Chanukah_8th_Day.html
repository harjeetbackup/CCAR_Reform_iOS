  <body>
    <h2>Chanukah (Day 8)</h2>
    <p>Chanukah begins on the twenty-fifth day of the Hebrew month of
      Kislev and lasts for eight days. It commemorates the victory of
      Judah Maccabee and his followers over the forces of the
      Greco-Syrian tyrant Antiochus Ephiphanes and the rededication of
      the Temple in Jerusalem, which the Syrians had profaned. Chanukah
      celebrates more than the end of an unsuccessful attempt by an
      outside power to destroy Judaism. The threat to Judaism was both
      internal and external. The assimilation to Hellenistic culture was
      so great that certain elements within Jewish society sought to
      become fully assimilated, to be accepted as Greek citizens, and to
      participate in Greek culture at the expense of their own unique
      Judaic culture. The resistance of the Maccabees and their allies
      to the blandishments of assimilation preserved Judaism. The story
      of Chanukah is the age-old struggle of the Jewish people to remain
      Jewish in a non-Jewish world.</p>
