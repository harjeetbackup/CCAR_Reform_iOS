<h3>Tu B'Av</h3>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>Tu B'Av is a post-Biblical holiday, though its exact origins are unknown. It served as a matchmaking day in Second Temple times and is described in the Talmud as one of the year's happiest days: young Jewish women would dress in white and dance in the vineyards, and young bachelors would follow them in search of a bride. The holiday was revived in the modern state of Israel and is now celebrated as a day of love.</p>
