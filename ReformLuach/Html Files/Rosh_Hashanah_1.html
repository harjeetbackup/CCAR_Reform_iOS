    <h2>Rosh HaShanah Day 1</h2>
    <p>Rosh HaShanah, which falls on the first of the Hebrew month of
      Tishrei, marks the beginning of the new year. It is, however, far
      more than the first day of the calendar year. It is the beginning
      of a ten-day period of rigorous introspection and self-examination
      that continues through Yom Kippur. So important did the Rabbis
      consider this period, that they proclaimed the whole of the
      preceding month of Elul as a period of preparation.</p>

    <p><strong>Afternoon<br>
      </strong><i>Tashlich</i>:<br>
      We hold the <i>Tashlich</i> ceremony in the afternoon at a
      natural body of water.<br>
      This ritual is based on Micah 7:18-20, and many congregations
      recite these verses as part of the ceremony. When the first day of
      Rosh HaShanah falls on Shabbat, we do <i>Tashlich</i> on the
      second day of Rosh HaShanah. </p>
    <p><strong>Birkat Hamazon</strong> <br>
      Add <i>Yaaleh v'Yavo </i>and <i>Harachaman </i>for Rosh
      HaShanah to <i>Birkat HaMazon</i>.</p>
    <p><strong>During Lunch<br>
      </strong>Recite the <i>Kiddush </i>for Rosh HaShanah day.<br>
      Some dip apples into honey (others only do this on Rosh HaShanah
      evening). For the ritual, see Rosh HaShanah evening.<br>
      Make <i>HaMotzi </i>over two round challot. </p>
    <p><strong>Candlelighting</strong> <br>
      We place a new fruit on the table during candlelighting and <i>Kiddush</i>.
      When we recite <i>Shehecheyanu</i> during candlelighting and <i>Kiddush</i>,
      we have in mind that we are reciting it over the new fruit as
      well.<br>
      After dark, we light candles. We recite the festival candle
      blessing and <i>Shehecheyanu</i> (MT 384)</p>
    <strong>During Dinner<br>
    </strong>Recite <i>Kiddush</i> for Rosh HaShanah evening, followed
    by <i>Shehecheyanu</i>.<br>
    We then say a blessing over the new fruit and eat it.<br>
    Make <i>HaMotzi</i> over two round challot.

      <h3><i>Aseret Y'mei T'shuvah</i></h3>
      <strong>General Notes<br>
      </strong>During the <em>Aseret Y'mei T'shuvah</em> (10 days of
      repentance from Rosh HaShanah through Yom Kippur):<br>
      Historically, congregations continue reciting <i>S'lichot </i>each
      morning before <i>Shacharit</i>. When reciting every <i>Kaddish</i>,
      the words "<em>l'eilah min kol</em>," are changed to "<em>l'eilah
        u'l'eilah mi-kol</em>."<br>
      When reciting the <i>Amidah</i>, include passages marked "Between
      Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur."<br>
      We continue to conclude our <i>Shacharit</i> and <i>Maariv</i>
      services with<em> Achat Shaalti</em> (MT 662).
