    <h3>Tu BiSh'vat</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>Tu BiSh'vat is also called the new year for trees and is one of
      the four new years mentioned in <i>Mishnah</i> <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>
      1:1. It is considered the time when trees begin a new
      fruit-bearing cycle after winter. For purposes of tithing, fruit
      harvested after Tu BiSh'vat was considered as belonging to a new
      crop year. There is no established liturgy for Tu BiSh'vat and
      there are not mitzvot associated with it. There are many different
      customs and possible ways to observe Tu BiSh'vat; customary
      observances include eating fruits grown in Israel, particularly
      the fruits mentioned in the Torah (e.g. grapes, figs,
      pomegranates), holding a Tu BiSh'vat Seder, and planting trees in
      Israel.</p>
