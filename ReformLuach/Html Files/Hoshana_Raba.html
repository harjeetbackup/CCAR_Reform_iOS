    <h2>Sukkot (Chol Hamoed)<br>
      Hoshana Rabbah</h2>
    <strong>General Notes</strong><br>
    Historically, Hoshana Rabbah is considered to be the day of the
    final sealing of God's judgement. The liturgy for the day is an
    interesting mixture of weekday and festival liturgy, and we
    alternate between <i>nusach </i>for weekdays, festivals, <i>S'lichot</i>,
    and the High Holy Days.
    <p><strong><i>Shacharit</i><br>
      </strong>Add <em>Yaaleh v'Yavo</em> for <em>Sukkot</em> to the <i>Amidah
      </i>(MT 92).<br>
      Perform <em>N'tilat Lulav</em> (taking of the <i>Lulav</i>)
      after the <i>Amidah</i> (MT 571).<br>
      Recite the full <i>Hallel </i>after the <i>Amidah</i> (560).
      The <i>Hallel</i> on page 560 is the half <i>Hallel</i>;
      congregations that would like to recite a full <i>Hallel </i>should
      add appropriate selections from Psalms 115 and 116.<br>
      Historically, after <i>Hallel</i>, the congregation would make
      seven processions around the synagogue and recite seven <i>Hoshanot</i>.
      After the <i>Hoshanot</i>, the congregation would beat the <i>Aravot
      </i>against the floor.

      It is a mitzvah to welcome guests into our Sukkah. Each night of
      Sukkot, we symbolically welcome some of our patriarchs and
      matriarchs into our Sukkah as guests. The liturgy of this ceremony
      can be found in <a
