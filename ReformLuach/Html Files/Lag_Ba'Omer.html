    <h3>Lag Ba'Omer</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>On Lag Ba'Omer, the thirty-third day of the period of counting
      the omer, we celebrate a semi-holiday. Tradition teaches that
      there was a break in the Hadrianic persecutions on this day, and
      also that the plague afflicting Rabbi Akiva's students was
      suspended for one day. There are no special rituals, nor is there
      a special liturgy for Lag Ba'Omer, but many celebrate outdoors with a campfire.</p>
