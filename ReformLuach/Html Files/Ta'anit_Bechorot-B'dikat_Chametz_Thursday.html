    <p><i><strong>Taanit B'chorot</strong></i></p>
    <p>Historicly, first-born males fast on this day. <i>Taanit
        B'chorot</i> recognizes that the first-born children of the
      Israelites were saved when the first-born children of the
      Egpytians were killed. &nbsp;When Pesach begins on Saturday night,
      this fast is moved to the Thursday before Pesach.</p>
