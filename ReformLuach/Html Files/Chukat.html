    <h2>Parashat Chukat </h2>
    <p>Numbers 19:1-22:1</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The laws of the red heifer to purify a person who has had
        contact with a corpse are given. (19:1-22)</li>
      <li>The people arrive at the wilderness of Zin. Miriam dies and is
        buried there. (20:1)</li>
      <li>The people complain that they have no water. Moses strikes the
        rock to get water for them. God tells Moses and Aaron they will
        not enter the Land of Israel. (20:2-13)</li>
      <li>The king of Edom refuses to let the Children of Israel pass
        through his land. After Aaron's priestly garments are given to
        his son Eleazer, Aaron dies. (20:14-29)</li>
      <li>After they are punished for complaining about the lack of
        bread and water, the Israelites repent and are victorious in
        battle against the Amorites and the people of Bashan, whose
        lands they capture. (21:4-22:1)</li>
    </ul>
