    <h3>Shabbat Parah</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>Shabbat Parah is the third of the five special Shabbatot before
      Pesach. The additional Torah portion we read on this day (Numbers
      19:1-22) describes the ritual of the <i>Parah Adumah</i>, the red
      heifer. After the heifer was slaughtered and burned, its ashes
      were used to purify members of the Israelite community who, in
      their state of impurity, would not be allowed to partake of the
      Passover sacrifice. The Haftarah from Ezekiel discusses a process
      of moral and spiritual cleansing.</p>
