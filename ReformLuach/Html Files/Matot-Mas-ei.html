    <p><strong>Torah Reading Notes</strong><br>
      We conclude the book of Numbers. The final verse of the book is
      chanted with a special melody. As the reader finishes chanting,
      the congregation rises. Before the oleh chants the concluding
      Torah blessing, the congregation chants "Chazak, Chazak,
      V'nitchazek." The Torah reader then chants the same words. The
      oleh then recites the concluding Torah blessing. For more detailed
      instructions and to hear this melody chanted, see ATC 81. </p>
