    <h2>Erev Sukkot</h2>
    <p> Sukkot begins on the fifteenth of the Hebrew month of Tishrei
      and concludes on the twenty-second with Sh’mini Atzeret–Simchat
      Torah. Sukkot is the fall harvest festival. The eighth day,
      Sh’mini Atzeret, functions as the conclusion of Sukkot but is also
      a separate festival. Since Reform Jews follow the calendar of the
      Land of Israel and do not add a ninth day to the festival, we
      celebrate Simchat Torah and Sh’mini Atzeret on the same day. More
      than any other of the Pilgrimage Festivals, Sukkot, also known as
      <em>HeChag</em>, has retained its agricultural character. However,
      Sukkot is also the commemoration of a significant event in the
      life of the Jewish people: the journey through the wilderness
      toward the Land of Israel. The Torah identifies the <em>sukkah</em>
      (booth) with the temporary dwellings in which the Israelites lived
      during that journey (Leviticus 23:42).</p>
    <p>It is a mitzvah to welcome guests into our sukkah. Each night of
      Sukkot, we symbolically welcome some of our patriarchs and
      matriarchs into our sukkah as guests. The liturgy of this ceremony
      can be found in <a

          the Doorposts of Your House</em></a>, pp. 94-96.</p>
    <p><strong>Preparing for Sukkot</strong><br>
      Build a sukkah (for guidelines on building your sukkah, see JL
      113):<br>
      Acquire the four species (<em>arbaah minim</em>). These include an
      <i>etrog</i>, a <i>lulav</i>, two willow branches (<em>aravah</em>),

      and three myrtle branches (<em>hadas</em>). It is considered "<em>hiddur

        Mitzvah</em>" (beautification of the commandment) to acquire a
      beautiful <i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i>.<br>
      The <i>lulav</i>, <i>hadas</i>, and <i>aravah</i> are assembled
      in their holder as follows: Hold the <i>lulav</i> with the smooth
      spine toward you and slide in into the middle holder. Place one
      ring around the holder and one or two rings on the <i>lulav</i>
      itself to hold the fronds together. Do not place the highest ring
      less than four inches from the tip of the <i>lulav</i>. Place the
      myrtle branches in the right pocket. Place the willow branches in
      the left pocket.</p>
    <p><strong>Candlelighting<br>
      </strong>Light candles before sunset. Recite the candle blessing
      for festivals and <em>Shehecheyanu</em> (MT 384)</p>
    <p><strong><i>Maariv</i><br>
      </strong>Recite the festival evening service (MT 348).</p>
    <p><strong>During Dinner</strong> <br>
      Recite the <i>Kiddush</i> for festival evening (MT 386).<br>
      Recite the blessing over dwelling the sukkah, as well as <em>Shehecheyanu</em>.
      We only recite <em>Shehecheyanu</em> our first time eating in the
      sukkah.<br>
      Add <em>Yaaleh v'Yavo</em> for Sukkot, <em>Harachaman</em> for <i>Yom

        Tov</i>, and <em>Harachaman</em> for Sukkot to <i>Birkat
        HaMazon</i>.</p>
