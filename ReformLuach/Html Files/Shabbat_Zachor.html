    <h3>Shabbat Zachor</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>Shabbat Zachor is the second in a series of five special
      Shabbatot before Pesach. On Shabbat Zachor, we commemorate the
      actions of Amalek, who attacked the Israelites after they left
      Egypt. The Historic Haftarah from I Samuel continues on this
      theme, recalling a battle between the Israelites and Amalekites
      during the days of King Saul. In this Haftarah, the king of the
      Amalekites is identified as Agag. Shabbat Zachor occurs the week
      before Purim because, in <i>M'gilat Esther</i>, Haman is called
      an Agagite, and is thus considered to be a descendant of Amalek.
      Some Reform synagogues read a selection from the book of Esther as
      an alternative to the Historic Haftarah.</p>
