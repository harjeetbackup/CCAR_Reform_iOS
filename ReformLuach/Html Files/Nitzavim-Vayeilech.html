    <h2>Parashot N'tzavim/Vayeilech </h2>
    <p>Deuteronomy 29:9-31:30</p>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Moses tells the assembled people that God’s covenant speaks to
        them and to all of the generations who will follow. (29:9–14)</li>
      <li>God warns the Israelites that they will be punished if they
        act idolatrously, the way the inhabitants of the other nations
        do. (29:15–28)</li>
      <li>Moses reassures the people that God will not forsake them and
        that they can attain blessings by following God's commandments.
        (30:1–20)</li>
      <li>Moses prepares the people for his death and announces that
        Joshua will succeed him. (31:1–8)</li>
      <li>Moses instructs the priests and the elders regarding the
        importance of reading the Torah. (31:9–13)</li>
      <li>God informs Moses that upon his death, the people will commit
        idolatry and "many evils and troubles shall befall them." God
        tells Moses to teach the people a poem that will "be My
        witness." (31:14–30)</li>
