    <h3>Shabbat Sh'kalim</h3>
    <h4>General Notes</h4>
    <p>Shabbat Sh'kalim is the first of a series of five special
      Shabbatot before Passover. It is on the Shabbat before Rosh
      Chodesh Adar (Adar II, during leap years). In this week's
      additional Torah reading (Exodus 30:11-16), we read that every
      adult Jew contributed a half-shekel to the upkeep of the Tent of
      Meeting. The special Haftarah from II Kings commemorates the
      half-shekel each person contributed each year to the upkeep of the
      Temple. We commemorate this practice on Shabbat Sh'kalim, because
      the financial year for the Temple began in Nisan, so the
      half-shekel was generally collected a month earlier, in Adar. On
      Purim, synagogues often gather contributions to the poor; these
      contributions are called "<em>machatzit hashekel</em>" in memory
      of the half-shekel given in Temple times.</p>
