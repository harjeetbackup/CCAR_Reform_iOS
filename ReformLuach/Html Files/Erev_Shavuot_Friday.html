    <h2>Erev Shavuot</h2>
    <p>Shavuot occurs on the sixth of the Hebrew month of Sivan. The
      name Shavuot (meaning “weeks”) derives from its celebration seven
      weeks (a week of weeks) after Pesach.<br>
      Current observance is based on the Talmudic identification of
      Shavuot with the events at Sinai. Therefore it is called<em> z’man
        matan Torateinu</em>, “the season of the giving of the Torah.”
      On Shavuot, we celebrate our covenantal relationship with God and
      reaffirm our commitment to a Jewish life of study (<em>talmud
        Torah</em>) and practice (mitzvah). The significance of the
      events at Sinai derives not only from the receiving of mitzvot but
      also from their acceptance, as is illustrated in Israel’s
      response. The ceremony of confirmation (<em>Kabbalat Torah</em>)
      is a Reform innovation and has added a new dimension to the
      meaning of the festival. It provides an opportunity for students
      of post–bar/bat mitzvah age to affirm their relationship to
      Judaism and the Jewish people. <br>

      We recite an abbreviated <i>Kabbalat Shabbat</i>, consisting of
      Psalms 92 and 93. Some also recite a shortened form of <i>L'chah
        Dodi</i> before Psalms 92 and 93.<br>
      Recite festival <i>Amidah</i> with appropriate additions for
      Shavuot and Shabbat (MT 468)</p>
    <p><strong>During Dinner<br>

      Many have the custom of eating dairy meals on Shavuot.<br>
      Add Yaaleh v'Yavo for Shavuot and <em>Harachaman</em> for <i>Yom
        Tov</i> to <em>Birkat hamazon</em>. Also include <em>R'tzei</em>
      and <em>Harachaman</em> for Shabbat.</p>
