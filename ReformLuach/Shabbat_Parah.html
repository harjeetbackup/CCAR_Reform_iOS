<h3>Shabbat Parah</h3>
<h4>General Notes</h4>
<p>Shabbat Parah is the third of the five special Shabbatot before Pesach. The additional Torah portion we read on this day (Numbers 19:1-22) describes the ritual of the Parah Adumah, the red heifer. After the heifer was slaughtered and burned, its ashes were used to purify members of the Israelite community who, in their state of impurity, would not be allowed to partake of the Passover sacrifice. The Haftarah from Ezekiel discusses a process of moral and spiritual cleansing.</p>
